This is _____ and I am a constituent of _____. I‚Äôm reaching out to you to discuss the harmful effect Drax Power Station‚Äôs tree burning is having on communities in the UK, in the hopes that you can help to reduce biomass subsidies by writing to Alok Sharma and Kwasi Karteng.

This is _______ calling on behalf of the #AxeDrax campaign. I am a constituent of <strong>[YOUR CONSTITUENCY]</strong>. I‚Äôm phoning because I am very concerned about the climate crisis and I am particularly worried about Drax Power Station‚Äôs fossil fuel and tree burning. Are you aware that Drax Power Station is the greatest emitter of CO2 in the UK?\n    <ol>\n      <li><strong>(IF NO)</strong> OK. Although Drax is phasing out coal, their power stations are being converted into biomass plants, with the false claims that this is renewable energy, when in truth burning trees for energy contributes more CO2 to the atmosphere than coal per unit of electricity produced. <em>Continue to 3</em></li>\n      <li><strong>(IF YES)</strong> That‚Äôs good to know that you are aware that the biomass industry isn‚Äôt as clean as Drax claims. <em>Continue to 3</em></li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n  <li>Would you be willing to hear more about how Drax is harming communities in the UK?\n    <ol>\n      <li><strong>(IF NO)</strong> No problem. I think it‚Äôs really important that we remove Drax‚Äôs biofuel subsidies, and redirect those towards truly renewable sources of energy, such as solar and wind, instead of using them to transport wood pellets across the planet. It would be great if you could write to the BEIS ministers Alok Sharma and Kwasi Karteng, ask Parliamentary Questions about biofuel subsidies, and perhaps request a parliamentary debate around the issue.</li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n  <li><strong>(IF YES)</strong> Great. You might already know that the beginning of Drax‚Äôs biomass production is in the Southern USA, where large areas of forests are torn down and pelletised in factories. This process harms the communities because it takes away nature and increases pollution, ultimately having a negative effect on health. In the UK, these wood pellets come into a number of ports, one of the biggest being Liverpool‚Äôs Peel Ports. Communities in this area experience air pollution as a result of this, and Highways England are also planning to destroy the much loved Rimrose Valley to build a road that will increase transportation of wood pellets to Drax‚Äôs Power Station in Yorkshire, despite the claim that it will reduce traffic. This is one of several examples of communities that were never given a choice. Would you be willing to use your authority as an MP to change this?\n     1. <strong>(IF YES)</strong> Please could you write to Alok Sharma and Kwasi Karteng and ask them to switch biomass subsidies to genuine renewables under the Levy Control Framework, ask Parliamentary Questions about biofuel subsidies, and perhaps request a parliamentary debate around the issue. We can send you <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DYlkCzT29UNlhdWeM9ceQBJPqPFXlN4Z/view?usp=sharing\">a briefing</a> on this issue, please could you forward any replies back to my email. Thanks again for listening, have a good day.\n    <ol>\n      <li><strong>(IF NO).</strong> That‚Äôs OK.

In the UK, these wood pellets come into a number of ports, one of the biggest being Liverpool‚Äôs Peel Ports. Communities in this area experience air pollution as a result of this, and Highways England are also planning to destroy the much loved Rimrose Valley to build a road that is likely to increase transportation of wood pellets to Drax‚Äôs Power Station in Yorkshire, despite the claim that it will reduce traffic.

This is _______ calling on behalf of the #AxeDrax campaign. I am a constituent of <strong>[YOUR CONSTITUENCY]</strong>. I‚Äôm phoning because I am very concerned about the climate crisis and I am particularly worried about Drax Power Station‚Äôs fossil fuel and tree burning. Are you aware that Drax Power Station is the greatest emitter of CO2 in the UK?\n    <ol>\n      <li><strong>(IF NO)</strong> OK. Although Drax is phasing out coal, their power stations are being converted into biomass plants, with the false claims that this is renewable energy, when in truth burning trees for energy contributes more CO2 to the atmosphere than coal per unit of electricity produced. <em>Continue to 3</em></li>\n      <li><strong>(IF YES)</strong> That‚Äôs good to know that you are aware that the biomass industry isn‚Äôt as clean as Drax claims. <em>Continue to 3</em></li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n  <li>Would you be willing to hear more about how Drax is harming communities in the UK?\n    <ol>\n      <li><strong>(IF NO)</strong> No problem. I think it‚Äôs really important that we remove Drax‚Äôs biofuel subsidies, and redirect those towards truly renewable sources of energy, such as solar and wind, instead of using them to transport wood pellets across the planet. It would be great if you could write to the BEIS ministers Alok Sharma and Kwasi Karteng, ask Parliamentary Questions about biofuel subsidies, and perhaps request a parliamentary debate around the issue.</li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n  <li><strong>(IF YES)</strong> Great. You might already know that the beginning of Drax‚Äôs biomass production is in the Southern USA, where large areas of forests are torn down and pelletised in factories. This process harms the communities because it takes away nature and increases pollution, ultimately having a negative effect on health. In the UK, these wood pellets come into a number of ports, one of the biggest being Liverpool‚Äôs Peel Ports. Communities in this area experience air pollution as a result of this, and Highways England are also planning to destroy the much loved Rimrose Valley to build a road that will increase transportation of wood pellets to Drax‚Äôs Power Station in Yorkshire, despite the claim that it will reduce traffic. This is one of several examples of communities that were never given a choice. Would you be willing to use your authority as an MP to change this?\n     1. <strong>(IF YES)</strong> Please could you write to Alok Sharma and Kwasi Karteng and ask them to switch biomass subsidies to genuine renewables under the Levy Control Framework, ask Parliamentary Questions about biofuel subsidies, and perhaps request a parliamentary debate around the issue. We can send you <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DYlkCzT29UNlhdWeM9ceQBJPqPFXlN4Z/view?usp=sharing\">a briefing</a> on this issue, please could you forward any replies back to my email.

This is _______ calling on behalf of the #AxeDrax campaign. I am a constituent of <strong>[YOUR CONSTITUENCY]</strong>. I‚Äôm phoning because I am very concerned about the climate crisis and I am particularly worried about Drax Power Station‚Äôs fossil fuel and tree burning. Are you aware that Drax Power Station is the greatest emitter of CO2 in the UK?\n    <ol>\n      <li><strong>(IF NO)</strong> OK. Although Drax is phasing out coal, their power stations are being converted into biomass plants, with the false claims that this is renewable energy, when in truth burning trees for energy contributes more CO2 to the atmosphere than coal per unit of electricity produced. <em>Continue to 3</em></li>\n      <li><strong>(IF YES)</strong> That‚Äôs good to know that you are aware that the biomass industry isn‚Äôt as clean as Drax claims. <em>Continue to 3</em></li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n  <li>Would you be willing to hear more about how Drax is harming communities in the UK?\n    <ol>\n      <li><strong>(IF NO)</strong> No problem. I think it‚Äôs really important that we remove Drax‚Äôs biofuel subsidies, and redirect those towards truly renewable sources of energy, such as solar and wind, instead of using them to transport wood pellets across the planet. It would be great if you could write to the BEIS ministers Alok Sharma and Kwasi Karteng, ask Parliamentary Questions about biofuel subsidies, and perhaps request a parliamentary debate around the issue.</li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n  <li><strong>(IF YES)</strong> Great. You might already know that the beginning of Drax‚Äôs biomass production is in the Southern USA, where large areas of forests are torn down and pelletised in factories. This process harms the communities because it takes away nature and increases pollution, ultimately having a negative effect on health. In the UK, these wood pellets come into a number of ports, one of the biggest being Liverpool‚Äôs Peel Ports. Communities in this area experience air pollution as a result of this, and Highways England are also planning to destroy the much loved Rimrose Valley to build a road that will increase transportation of wood pellets to Drax‚Äôs Power Station in Yorkshire, despite the claim that it will reduce traffic. This is one of several examples of communities that were never given a choice. Would you be willing to use your authority as an MP to change this?\n     1. <strong>(IF YES)</strong> Please could you write to Alok Sharma and Kwasi Karteng and ask them to switch biomass subsidies to genuine renewables under the Levy Control Framework, ask Parliamentary Questions about biofuel subsidies, and perhaps request a parliamentary debate around the issue. We can send you <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DYlkCzT29UNlhdWeM9ceQBJPqPFXlN4Z/view?usp=sharing\">a briefing</a> on this issue, please could you forward any replies back to my email.

I am calling to talk to you about Drax Power Station. Are you aware that Drax Power Station is the greatest emitter of CO2 in the UK?\n    <ol>\n      <li><strong>(IF YES)</strong> - That‚Äôs good to know _(Skip to <strong>3</strong>) _</li>\n      <li><strong>(IF NO)</strong> - No problem (<strong>Explain about Drax, use the FAQ document</strong>)</li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n  <li>That‚Äôs good to know that you are aware that the biomass industry isn‚Äôt as clean as Drax claims. Would you be willing to hear more about how Drax is harming communities in the UK and USA?\n    <ol>\n      <li><strong>(IF YES)</strong> - Great! You might already know that the beginning of Drax‚Äôs biomass production is in the Southern USA, where large areas of forests are torn down and pelletised in factories. This process harms the communities because it takes away nature and increases pollution, ultimately having a negative effect on health. In the UK, these wood pellets come into a number of ports, one of the biggest being Liverpool‚Äôs Peel Ports. Communities in this area experience air pollution as a result of this, and Highways England are also planning to destroy the much loved Rimrose Valley to build a road that is likely to increase transportation of wood pellets to Drax‚Äôs Power Station in Yorkshire, despite the claim that it will reduce traffic. This is one of several examples of communities that were never given a choice. Could you take these issues to Alok Sharma and ask him to move subsidies for biomass to genuine renewables under the Levy Control Framework. <em>(ask for direct email to send details on)</em></li>\n      <li><strong>(IF NO)</strong> - No problem.

Please do not harass or threaten anyone over the phone during this action, as this is not necessary and can put you at risk of charge. Our job is to educate people on the harm of large scale biomass projects. Making calls to be annoying is not helpful for the following numbers, as you will most likely just be talking to a secretary or possibly a call centre worker.\nIf however, you manage to in contact with anyone who actually has power be as annoying as you like!</p>\n<h1 id=\"briefing\">Briefing</h1>\n<ol>\n  <li>For each contact, there is a main script, a nuance document and a left message.\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>Main Script</strong>: skeleton guidance for your call.

This is _______ calling on behalf of the #AxeDrax campaign. I am a constituent of <strong>[YOUR CONSTITUENCY]</strong>. I‚Äôm phoning because I am very concerned about the climate crisis and I am particularly worried about Drax Power Station‚Äôs fossil fuel and tree burning. Are you aware that Drax Power Station is the greatest emitter of CO2 in the UK?\n    <ol>\n      <li><strong>(IF NO)</strong> OK. Although Drax is phasing out coal, their power stations are being converted into biomass plants, with the false claims that this is renewable energy, when in truth burning trees for energy contributes more CO2 to the atmosphere than coal per unit of electricity produced. <em>Continue to 3</em></li>\n      <li><strong>(IF YES)</strong> That‚Äôs good to know that you are aware that the biomass industry isn‚Äôt as clean as Drax claims. <em>Continue to 3</em></li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n  <li>Would you be willing to hear more about how Drax is harming communities in the UK?\n    <ol>\n      <li><strong>(IF NO)</strong> No problem. I think it‚Äôs really important that we remove Drax‚Äôs biofuel subsidies, and redirect those towards truly renewable sources of energy, such as solar and wind, instead of using them to transport wood pellets across the planet. It would be great if you could write to the BEIS ministers Alok Sharma and Kwasi Karteng, ask Parliamentary Questions about biofuel subsidies, and perhaps request a parliamentary debate around the issue.</li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n  <li><strong>(IF YES)</strong> Great. You might already know that the beginning of Drax‚Äôs biomass production is in the Southern USA, where large areas of forests are torn down and pelletised in factories. This process harms the communities because it takes away nature and increases pollution, ultimately having a negative effect on health. In the UK, these wood pellets come into a number of ports, one of the biggest being Liverpool‚Äôs Peel Ports. Communities in this area experience air pollution as a result of this, and Highways England are also planning to destroy the much loved Rimrose Valley to build a road that will increase transportation of wood pellets to Drax‚Äôs Power Station in Yorkshire, despite the claim that it will reduce traffic. This is one of several examples of communities that were never given a choice. Would you be willing to use your authority as an MP to change this?\n     1. <strong>(IF YES)</strong> Please could you write to Alok Sharma and Kwasi Karteng and ask them to switch biomass subsidies to genuine renewables under the Levy Control Framework, ask Parliamentary Questions about biofuel subsidies, and perhaps request a parliamentary debate around the issue.

Last year, Drax announced that it wanted to go further and turn its plant into the ‚Äú<a href=\"https://www.drax.com/press_release/europes-first-bioenergy-carbon-capture-storage-pilot-now-underway/\">first carbon negative power station</a>‚Äù.\nIt entered into a partnership with startup company, <a href=\"https://www.c-capture.co.uk/\">C-Capture</a>, to try and capture one tonne of carbon dioxide daily. This carbon dioxide was to be sold to pubs to ‚Äú<a href=\"https://www.drax.com/press_release/drax-help-keep-fizz-drinks-sector/\">help keep the fizz</a>‚Äù in beer.\n<a href=\"https://www.power-technology.com/features/draxs-carbon-capture/\">As of May</a>, the process was not working reliably, and no carbon dioxide was stored or sold. <a href=\"https://www.biofuelwatch.org.uk/2019/beccs-pilot-farce/\">This is not surprising</a>: C-Capture, though founded in 2009, had participated in no previous projects, obtained no patents and published no scientific studies. Instead of using a tried-and-tested solvent for capturing carbon, it chose to make its own, without disclosing any details. [‚Ä¶]\n<strong>The inclusion of BECCS into climate policies is dangerous: because BECCS is unlikely to work and, if it did, likely to result in extra carbon dioxide emissions from increased logging and land conversion.</strong>\n<a href=\"https://www.scotsman.com/news/opinion/burning-trees-will-not-save-us-climate-crisis-richard-dixon-3112293\">Burning trees will not save us from the climate crisis - Richard Dixon (26/1/21)</a>\nThe new report shows how <strong>BECCS is being used as a get out of jail card by governments and companies to do little about climate change but tell us all it‚Äôs going to be alright</strong>. BECCS is popular because countries around the world looked at their expected emissions, saw the widening gap between the trajectory they are on and the targets they are supposed to meet, and simply plugged in the magic unicorn of BECCS to fill the gap.\n<strong>[‚Ä¶] There is no fully-functioning BECCS scheme operating anywhere in the world.</strong>\nOf course, planting trees can be a great thing to do but <strong>to make BECCS work at scale you need a huge amount of plant material or timber. This would only be possible by destroying natural forests and converting large areas of arable land into monoculture plantations, displacing people, trashing nature and competing with food production.</strong> One estimate is that we would need twice as much land as is currently cultivated on a global scale and, according to an assessment in 2019, BECCS at massive scale would threaten an additional 150 million people with hunger.\n<a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/hdmmcnd0d1d2lq5/Scientist%20Letter%20to%20Biden%2C%20von%20der%20Leyen%2C%20Michel%2C%20Suga%20%26%20Moon%20%20Re.%20Forest%20Biomass%20%28February%2011%2C%202021%29.pdf?dl=0\">Letter Regarding Use of Forests for Bioenergy, 11/2/2021</a>\nAnd some related press releases:\n    - <a href=\"https://www.ecowatch.com/scientists-demand-stop-burning-trees-2650534163.html\">500+ Scientists Demand Stop to Tree Burning as Climate Solution</a>\n    - <a href=\"https://www.wwf.eu/?uNewsID=2128466\">From WWF</a>\nIn recent years, however, there has been a misguided move to cut down whole trees or to divert large portions of stem wood for bioenergy, releasing carbon that would otherwise stay locked up in forests.\nThe result of this additional wood harvest is a large initial increase in carbon emissions, creating a ‚Äúcarbon debt,‚Äù which increases over time as more trees are harvested for continuing bioenergy use. <strong>Regrowing trees and displacement of fossil fuels may eventually pay off this carbon debt, but regrowth takes time the world does not have to solve climate change.</strong>\n<strong>As numerous studies have shown, this burning of wood will increase warming for decades to centuries. That is true even when the wood replaces coal, oil or natural gas. [‚Ä¶]</strong>\n<strong>To avoid these harms, governments must end subsidies and other incentives that today exist for the burning of wood whether from their forests or others. The European Union needs to stop treating the burning of biomass as carbon neutral in its renewable energy standards and in its emissions trading system.</strong>\n‚ÄúGlobal Markets for Biomass Energy are Devastating US Forests‚Äù (2019)\n<a href=\"https://www.dogwoodalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Biomass-Investigation-Booklet-2019.pdf\">Investigation booklet into the sourcing of wood biomass from Southern US forests</a> by the world‚Äôs largest wood pellet producer, Enviva. This wood is being transported from the Southern US to burn in UK &amp; European power stations, including Drax\n<strong>Despite the claims of the industry, the independent reporting shows a disturbing pattern: wood pellets burned by Drax and others come from wood that is harvested from native hardwood forests in an area designated as a global biodiversity hotspot.</strong> They also spotlight the vast quantities of whole trees and other large-diameter wood‚Äî biomass feedstocks known to be high-carbon‚Äîthat are entering Enviva‚Äôs supply chain.\n**Not only is this devastating for these irreplaceable forests, but it‚Äôs worsening our Earth‚Äôs climate crisis. Multiple independent, peer-reviewed studies have determined that burning biomass from forests for electricity creates more carbon dioxide emissions than burning coal, and that increased carbon dioxide concentrations persist in the atmosphere for decades or more‚Äù‚Äù\nIn March 2019, investigators in North Carolina again tracked logging trucks from a mature hardwood forest to Enviva‚Äôs Northampton wood pellet mill. In January 2018, reporters from the UK Channel 4 News program Dispatches traveled to North Carolina to examine what is happening on the ground in the forests that have become ground zero for feeding Drax Power Station‚Äôs voracious demand for wood. <strong>The images from the Dispatches investigation tell a story of ecological devastation in the name of clean energy: a once majestic wetland forest clearcut to supply wood to Enviva, and ultimately to Drax.</strong></p>\n        </blockquote>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n","next":{"id":"/actions/social-media","categories":[],"title":"Social Media","tags":null,"collection":"actions","path":"_actions/social-media.md","date":"2022-11-07 14:36:47 +0000","url":"/actions/social-media/","relative_path":"_actions/social-media.md","draft":false,"status":"Published","summary":"Share and promote discussion around Drax.

This means that BECCS will create competition for land among food producers, as more and more cropland will be dedicated to growing crops for fuel.

Last year, Drax announced that it wanted to go further and turn its plant into the ‚Äú<a href=\"https://www.drax.com/press_release/europes-first-bioenergy-carbon-capture-storage-pilot-now-underway/\">first carbon negative power station</a>‚Äù.\nIt entered into a partnership with startup company, <a href=\"https://www.c-capture.co.uk/\">C-Capture</a>, to try and capture one tonne of carbon dioxide daily. This carbon dioxide was to be sold to pubs to ‚Äú<a href=\"https://www.drax.com/press_release/drax-help-keep-fizz-drinks-sector/\">help keep the fizz</a>‚Äù in beer.\n<a href=\"https://www.power-technology.com/features/draxs-carbon-capture/\">As of May</a>, the process was not working reliably, and no carbon dioxide was stored or sold. <a href=\"https://www.biofuelwatch.org.uk/2019/beccs-pilot-farce/\">This is not surprising</a>: C-Capture, though founded in 2009, had participated in no previous projects, obtained no patents and published no scientific studies. Instead of using a tried-and-tested solvent for capturing carbon, it chose to make its own, without disclosing any details. [‚Ä¶]\n<strong>The inclusion of BECCS into climate policies is dangerous: because BECCS is unlikely to work and, if it did, likely to result in extra carbon dioxide emissions from increased logging and land conversion.</strong>\n<a href=\"https://www.scotsman.com/news/opinion/burning-trees-will-not-save-us-climate-crisis-richard-dixon-3112293\">Burning trees will not save us from the climate crisis - Richard Dixon (26/1/21)</a>\nThe new report shows how <strong>BECCS is being used as a get out of jail card by governments and companies to do little about climate change but tell us all it‚Äôs going to be alright</strong>. BECCS is popular because countries around the world looked at their expected emissions, saw the widening gap between the trajectory they are on and the targets they are supposed to meet, and simply plugged in the magic unicorn of BECCS to fill the gap.\n<strong>[‚Ä¶] There is no fully-functioning BECCS scheme operating anywhere in the world.</strong>\nOf course, planting trees can be a great thing to do but <strong>to make BECCS work at scale you need a huge amount of plant material or timber. This would only be possible by destroying natural forests and converting large areas of arable land into monoculture plantations, displacing people, trashing nature and competing with food production.</strong> One estimate is that we would need twice as much land as is currently cultivated on a global scale and, according to an assessment in 2019, BECCS at massive scale would threaten an additional 150 million people with hunger.\n<a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/hdmmcnd0d1d2lq5/Scientist%20Letter%20to%20Biden%2C%20von%20der%20Leyen%2C%20Michel%2C%20Suga%20%26%20Moon%20%20Re.%20Forest%20Biomass%20%28February%2011%2C%202021%29.pdf?dl=0\">Letter Regarding Use of Forests for Bioenergy, 11/2/2021</a>\nAnd some related press releases:\n    - <a href=\"https://www.ecowatch.com/scientists-demand-stop-burning-trees-2650534163.html\">500+ Scientists Demand Stop to Tree Burning as Climate Solution</a>\n    - <a href=\"https://www.wwf.eu/?uNewsID=2128466\">From WWF</a>\nIn recent years, however, there has been a misguided move to cut down whole trees or to divert large portions of stem wood for bioenergy, releasing carbon that would otherwise stay locked up in forests.\nThe result of this additional wood harvest is a large initial increase in carbon emissions, creating a ‚Äúcarbon debt,‚Äù which increases over time as more trees are harvested for continuing bioenergy use. <strong>Regrowing trees and displacement of fossil fuels may eventually pay off this carbon debt, but regrowth takes time the world does not have to solve climate change.</strong>\n<strong>As numerous studies have shown, this burning of wood will increase warming for decades to centuries. That is true even when the wood replaces coal, oil or natural gas. [‚Ä¶]</strong>\n<strong>To avoid these harms, governments must end subsidies and other incentives that today exist for the burning of wood whether from their forests or others. The European Union needs to stop treating the burning of biomass as carbon neutral in its renewable energy standards and in its emissions trading system.</strong>\n‚ÄúGlobal Markets for Biomass Energy are Devastating US Forests‚Äù (2019)\n<a href=\"https://www.dogwoodalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Biomass-Investigation-Booklet-2019.pdf\">Investigation booklet into the sourcing of wood biomass from Southern US forests</a> by the world‚Äôs largest wood pellet producer, Enviva. This wood is being transported from the Southern US to burn in UK &amp; European power stations, including Drax\n<strong>Despite the claims of the industry, the independent reporting shows a disturbing pattern: wood pellets burned by Drax and others come from wood that is harvested from native hardwood forests in an area designated as a global biodiversity hotspot.</strong> They also spotlight the vast quantities of whole trees and other large-diameter wood‚Äî biomass feedstocks known to be high-carbon‚Äîthat are entering Enviva‚Äôs supply chain.\n**Not only is this devastating for these irreplaceable forests, but it‚Äôs worsening our Earth‚Äôs climate crisis. Multiple independent, peer-reviewed studies have determined that burning biomass from forests for electricity creates more carbon dioxide emissions than burning coal, and that increased carbon dioxide concentrations persist in the atmosphere for decades or more‚Äù‚Äù\nIn March 2019, investigators in North Carolina again tracked logging trucks from a mature hardwood forest to Enviva‚Äôs Northampton wood pellet mill. In January 2018, reporters from the UK Channel 4 News program Dispatches traveled to North Carolina to examine what is happening on the ground in the forests that have become ground zero for feeding Drax Power Station‚Äôs voracious demand for wood. <strong>The images from the Dispatches investigation tell a story of ecological devastation in the name of clean energy: a once majestic wetland forest clearcut to supply wood to Enviva, and ultimately to Drax.</strong></p>\n        </blockquote>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n\n  </article>\n</main>\n\n    <footer>\n  <div class=\"social\">\n    <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/axedraxlovetrees\"><img class=\"icon\" src=\"/assets/images/facebook.svg\" title=\"Facebook\" alt=\"Facebook page\"></a>\n    <a href=\"https://instagram.com/axe_drax\"><img class=\"icon\" src=\"/assets/images/instagram.svg\" alt=\"Instagram page\" title=\"Instagram\"></a>\n    <a href=\"https://t.me/axedrax\"><img class=\"icon\" src=\"/assets/images/telegram.svg\" alt=\"Telegram broardcast\" title=\"Telegram\"></a>\n    <a href=\"mailto:axedrax@pm.me\"><img class=\"icon\" src=\"/assets/images/email_icon.svg\" alt=\"Send email to axedrax@pm.me\" title=\"Email\"></a>\n  </div>\n</footer>\n\n  </body>\n</html>\n","excerpt":"","draft":false,"status":"Published","summary":"Pop in to talks and promotions hosted by Drax to educate fellow attendees.

This is _______ calling on behalf of the #AxeDrax campaign. I am a constituent of <strong>[YOUR CONSTITUENCY]</strong>. I‚Äôm phoning because I am very concerned about the climate crisis and I am particularly worried about Drax Power Station‚Äôs fossil fuel and tree burning. Are you aware that Drax Power Station is the greatest emitter of CO2 in the UK?\n    <ol>\n      <li><strong>(IF NO)</strong> OK. Although Drax is phasing out coal, their power stations are being converted into biomass plants, with the false claims that this is renewable energy, when in truth burning trees for energy contributes more CO2 to the atmosphere than coal per unit of electricity produced. <em>Continue to 3</em></li>\n      <li><strong>(IF YES)</strong> That‚Äôs good to know that you are aware that the biomass industry isn‚Äôt as clean as Drax claims. <em>Continue to 3</em></li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n  <li>Would you be willing to hear more about how Drax is harming communities in the UK?\n    <ol>\n      <li><strong>(IF NO)</strong> No problem. I think it‚Äôs really important that we remove Drax‚Äôs biofuel subsidies, and redirect those towards truly renewable sources of energy, such as solar and wind, instead of using them to transport wood pellets across the planet. It would be great if you could write to the BEIS ministers Alok Sharma and Kwasi Karteng, ask Parliamentary Questions about biofuel subsidies, and perhaps request a parliamentary debate around the issue.</li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n  <li><strong>(IF YES)</strong> Great. You might already know that the beginning of Drax‚Äôs biomass production is in the Southern USA, where large areas of forests are torn down and pelletised in factories. This process harms the communities because it takes away nature and increases pollution, ultimately having a negative effect on health. In the UK, these wood pellets come into a number of ports, one of the biggest being Liverpool‚Äôs Peel Ports. Communities in this area experience air pollution as a result of this, and Highways England are also planning to destroy the much loved Rimrose Valley to build a road that will increase transportation of wood pellets to Drax‚Äôs Power Station in Yorkshire, despite the claim that it will reduce traffic. This is one of several examples of communities that were never given a choice. Would you be willing to use your authority as an MP to change this?\n     1. <strong>(IF YES)</strong> Please could you write to Alok Sharma and Kwasi Karteng and ask them to switch biomass subsidies to genuine renewables under the Levy Control Framework, ask Parliamentary Questions about biofuel subsidies, and perhaps request a parliamentary debate around the issue.

In the UK, these wood pellets come into a number of ports, one of the biggest being Liverpool‚Äôs Peel Ports.

This is one of several examples of communities that were never given a choice. Could you take these issues to Alok Sharma and ask him to move subsidies for biomass to genuine renewables under the Levy Control Framework. <em>(ask for direct email to send details on)</em></li>\n      <li><strong>(IF NO)</strong> - No problem.

This is _______ calling on behalf of the #AxeDrax campaign. It has come to our attention that Yeo Valley‚Äôs energy comes from Haven Power which is owned by Drax. Are you aware that Drax Power Station is the greatest emitter of CO2 in the UK? \\</li>\n  <li><strong>(IF NO).</strong> OK. Although Drax is phasing out coal, their power stations are being converted into biomass plants, with the false claims that this is renewable energy, when in truth it contributes more CO2 to the atmosphere than coal for the same amount of electricity. Would you be willing to hear more about how Drax is harming communities in the UK and the US?\n    <ol>\n      <li><strong>(IF NO)</strong> No problem. I think it is really important that companies like Yeo Valley stop supporting companies like Haven Power, Drax, and Enviva which take part in logging operations in the Southern USA that contribute to air, water and noise pollution in predominantly Black, indigenous and low-income communities - all hidden under lies about renewable energy. Would you be willing to write to me about whether Yeo Valley will continue to support the harmful, polluting biomass industry? <em>(give them your contact details if not hung up yet)</em></li>\n      <li><strong>(IF YES)</strong> Great. You might already know that the beginning of Drax‚Äôs biomass production is mostly in the Southern USA, where large areas of forests are torn down and pelletised in factories. This process contributes to air, water and noise pollution that hurts predominantly poorer and non-white communities. In the UK, these wood pellets come into a number of ports, one of the biggest being Liverpool‚Äôs Peel Ports. People in the area experience harmful air pollution due to this, and Highways England are also planning to destroy the much loved Rimrose Valley to build a road that is likely to increase transportation of wood pellets to Drax‚Äôs Power Station in Yorkshire, despite the claim that it will reduce traffic. This is one of several examples of communities that were never given a choice.

My name is _____ and I am calling from the Axe Drax campaign. Could you please get back to me on <em>[Number]</em> on whether Salford City Council will follow through on its declaration of a climate emergency and switch from Haven Power to a genuine renewable energy provider?</p>\n        <h3 id=\"main-script-3\">Main script</h3>\n      </li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n  <li>Hello _______ . This is _______ calling on behalf of the #AxeDrax campaign. It has come to our attention that Salford City Council‚Äôs energy comes from Haven Power which is owned by Drax. Are you aware that Drax Power Station is the greatest emitter of CO2 in the UK? \\</li>\n  <li><strong>(IF NO).</strong> OK. Although Drax is phasing out coal, their power stations are being converted into biomass plants, with the false claims that this is renewable energy, when in truth it contributes more CO2 to the atmosphere than coal for the same amount of electricity. Would you be willing to hear more about how Drax is harming communities in the UK and the US?\n    <ol>\n      <li><strong>(IF NO)</strong> No problem. I think it is really important that councils that have declared a climate emergency should stop supporting companies like Haven Power, Drax, and Enviva which take part in logging operations in the Southern USA that contribute to air, water and noise pollution in predominantly Black, Indigenous and low-income communities - all hidden under lies about renewable energy. Would you be willing to write to me about whether Salford City Council will continue to support the harmful, polluting biomass industry? <em>(give them your contact details if not hung up yet)</em></li>\n      <li><strong>(IF YES)</strong> Great. You might already know that the beginning of Drax‚Äôs biomass production is mostly in the Southern USA, where large areas of forests are torn down and pelletised in factories. This process contributes to air, water and noise pollution that hurts predominantly Black, Indigenous and low-income communities. In the UK, these wood pellets come into a number of ports, one of the biggest being Liverpool‚Äôs Peel Ports. People in the area experience harmful air pollution due to this, and Highways England are also planning to destroy the much loved Rimrose Valley to build a road that will increase transportation of wood pellets to Drax‚Äôs Power Station in Yorkshire, despite the claim that it will reduce traffic. This is one of several examples of communities that were never given a choice.

And what trials specific to the technology chosen are Drax‚Äôs BECCS assumptions based on?</strong>If BECCS technology were ever made to work in the future, it would mean an increased demand for wood to supply enough energy to capture and store the CO2. This would lead to more forest destruction and the conversion of huge areas of land to monoculture tree plantations in order to supply wood to burn in power stations <a href=\"https://www.scotsman.com/news/opinion/burning-trees-will-not-save-us-climate-crisis-richard-dixon-3112293\">1</a></li>\n      <li>For more information, <a href=\"https://www.foei.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Friends-of-the-Earth-International_BECCS_English.pdf\">please see page 2 of this report from Friends of the Earth International</a>: ‚Äú Providing enough biomass for BECCS, at the scale needed, would only be possible through deforestation, land-grabbing, and by converting large amounts of arable land into monoculture plantations. This means that BECCS will create competition for land among food producers, as more and more cropland will be dedicated to growing crops for fuel. In fact, it is estimated that rolling out BECCS at scale will require up to 3000 million hectares ‚Äì around twice the amount of land that is currently already cultivated, globally.‚Äù</li>\n      <li><strong>How much CO2 has Drax captured and stored so far in each of your two pilot projects and over what time period?</strong>Drax plans to capture 1 tonne of CO2 per day but as yet, has released all of it back into the atmosphere.

Last year, Drax announced that it wanted to go further and turn its plant into the ‚Äú<a href=\"https://www.drax.com/press_release/europes-first-bioenergy-carbon-capture-storage-pilot-now-underway/\">first carbon negative power station</a>‚Äù.\nIt entered into a partnership with startup company, <a href=\"https://www.c-capture.co.uk/\">C-Capture</a>, to try and capture one tonne of carbon dioxide daily. This carbon dioxide was to be sold to pubs to ‚Äú<a href=\"https://www.drax.com/press_release/drax-help-keep-fizz-drinks-sector/\">help keep the fizz</a>‚Äù in beer.\n<a href=\"https://www.power-technology.com/features/draxs-carbon-capture/\">As of May</a>, the process was not working reliably, and no carbon dioxide was stored or sold. <a href=\"https://www.biofuelwatch.org.uk/2019/beccs-pilot-farce/\">This is not surprising</a>: C-Capture, though founded in 2009, had participated in no previous projects, obtained no patents and published no scientific studies. Instead of using a tried-and-tested solvent for capturing carbon, it chose to make its own, without disclosing any details. [‚Ä¶]\n<strong>The inclusion of BECCS into climate policies is dangerous: because BECCS is unlikely to work and, if it did, likely to result in extra carbon dioxide emissions from increased logging and land conversion.</strong>\n<a href=\"https://www.scotsman.com/news/opinion/burning-trees-will-not-save-us-climate-crisis-richard-dixon-3112293\">Burning trees will not save us from the climate crisis - Richard Dixon (26/1/21)</a>\nThe new report shows how <strong>BECCS is being used as a get out of jail card by governments and companies to do little about climate change but tell us all it‚Äôs going to be alright</strong>. BECCS is popular because countries around the world looked at their expected emissions, saw the widening gap between the trajectory they are on and the targets they are supposed to meet, and simply plugged in the magic unicorn of BECCS to fill the gap.\n<strong>[‚Ä¶] There is no fully-functioning BECCS scheme operating anywhere in the world.</strong>\nOf course, planting trees can be a great thing to do but <strong>to make BECCS work at scale you need a huge amount of plant material or timber. This would only be possible by destroying natural forests and converting large areas of arable land into monoculture plantations, displacing people, trashing nature and competing with food production.</strong> One estimate is that we would need twice as much land as is currently cultivated on a global scale and, according to an assessment in 2019, BECCS at massive scale would threaten an additional 150 million people with hunger.\n<a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/hdmmcnd0d1d2lq5/Scientist%20Letter%20to%20Biden%2C%20von%20der%20Leyen%2C%20Michel%2C%20Suga%20%26%20Moon%20%20Re.%20Forest%20Biomass%20%28February%2011%2C%202021%29.pdf?dl=0\">Letter Regarding Use of Forests for Bioenergy, 11/2/2021</a>\nAnd some related press releases:\n    - <a href=\"https://www.ecowatch.com/scientists-demand-stop-burning-trees-2650534163.html\">500+ Scientists Demand Stop to Tree Burning as Climate Solution</a>\n    - <a href=\"https://www.wwf.eu/?uNewsID=2128466\">From WWF</a>\nIn recent years, however, there has been a misguided move to cut down whole trees or to divert large portions of stem wood for bioenergy, releasing carbon that would otherwise stay locked up in forests.\nThe result of this additional wood harvest is a large initial increase in carbon emissions, creating a ‚Äúcarbon debt,‚Äù which increases over time as more trees are harvested for continuing bioenergy use. <strong>Regrowing trees and displacement of fossil fuels may eventually pay off this carbon debt, but regrowth takes time the world does not have to solve climate change.</strong>\n<strong>As numerous studies have shown, this burning of wood will increase warming for decades to centuries. That is true even when the wood replaces coal, oil or natural gas. [‚Ä¶]</strong>\n<strong>To avoid these harms, governments must end subsidies and other incentives that today exist for the burning of wood whether from their forests or others. The European Union needs to stop treating the burning of biomass as carbon neutral in its renewable energy standards and in its emissions trading system.</strong>\n‚ÄúGlobal Markets for Biomass Energy are Devastating US Forests‚Äù (2019)\n<a href=\"https://www.dogwoodalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Biomass-Investigation-Booklet-2019.pdf\">Investigation booklet into the sourcing of wood biomass from Southern US forests</a> by the world‚Äôs largest wood pellet producer, Enviva. This wood is being transported from the Southern US to burn in UK &amp; European power stations, including Drax\n<strong>Despite the claims of the industry, the independent reporting shows a disturbing pattern: wood pellets burned by Drax and others come from wood that is harvested from native hardwood forests in an area designated as a global biodiversity hotspot.</strong> They also spotlight the vast quantities of whole trees and other large-diameter wood‚Äî biomass feedstocks known to be high-carbon‚Äîthat are entering Enviva‚Äôs supply chain.\n**Not only is this devastating for these irreplaceable forests, but it‚Äôs worsening our Earth‚Äôs climate crisis. Multiple independent, peer-reviewed studies have determined that burning biomass from forests for electricity creates more carbon dioxide emissions than burning coal, and that increased carbon dioxide concentrations persist in the atmosphere for decades or more‚Äù‚Äù\nIn March 2019, investigators in North Carolina again tracked logging trucks from a mature hardwood forest to Enviva‚Äôs Northampton wood pellet mill. In January 2018, reporters from the UK Channel 4 News program Dispatches traveled to North Carolina to examine what is happening on the ground in the forests that have become ground zero for feeding Drax Power Station‚Äôs voracious demand for wood. <strong>The images from the Dispatches investigation tell a story of ecological devastation in the name of clean energy: a once majestic wetland forest clearcut to supply wood to Enviva, and ultimately to Drax.</strong></p>\n        </blockquote>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n","next":{"id":"/actions/social-media","categories":[],"title":"Social Media","previous":{"id":"/actions/zoom","categories":[],"title":"Join Zoom calls","tags":null,"collection":"actions","path":"_actions/zoom.md","date":"2022-11-07 14:36:47 +0000","url":"/actions/zoom/","relative_path":"_actions/zoom.md","draft":false,"status":"Published","summary":"Pop in to talks and promotions hosted by Drax to educate fellow attendees.

BECCS is popular because countries around the world looked at their expected emissions, saw the widening gap between the trajectory they are on and the targets they are supposed to meet, and simply plugged in the magic unicorn of BECCS to fill the gap.\n<strong>[‚Ä¶] There is no fully-functioning BECCS scheme operating anywhere in the world.</strong>\nOf course, planting trees can be a great thing to do but <strong>to make BECCS work at scale you need a huge amount of plant material or timber. This would only be possible by destroying natural forests and converting large areas of arable land into monoculture plantations, displacing people, trashing nature and competing with food production.</strong> One estimate is that we would need twice as much land as is currently cultivated on a global scale and, according to an assessment in 2019, BECCS at massive scale would threaten an additional 150 million people with hunger.\n<a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/hdmmcnd0d1d2lq5/Scientist%20Letter%20to%20Biden%2C%20von%20der%20Leyen%2C%20Michel%2C%20Suga%20%26%20Moon%20%20Re.%20Forest%20Biomass%20%28February%2011%2C%202021%29.pdf?dl=0\">Letter Regarding Use of Forests for Bioenergy, 11/2/2021</a>\nAnd some related press releases:\n    - <a href=\"https://www.ecowatch.com/scientists-demand-stop-burning-trees-2650534163.html\">500+ Scientists Demand Stop to Tree Burning as Climate Solution</a>\n    - <a href=\"https://www.wwf.eu/?uNewsID=2128466\">From WWF</a>\nIn recent years, however, there has been a misguided move to cut down whole trees or to divert large portions of stem wood for bioenergy, releasing carbon that would otherwise stay locked up in forests.\nThe result of this additional wood harvest is a large initial increase in carbon emissions, creating a ‚Äúcarbon debt,‚Äù which increases over time as more trees are harvested for continuing bioenergy use. <strong>Regrowing trees and displacement of fossil fuels may eventually pay off this carbon debt, but regrowth takes time the world does not have to solve climate change.</strong>\n<strong>As numerous studies have shown, this burning of wood will increase warming for decades to centuries. That is true even when the wood replaces coal, oil or natural gas. [‚Ä¶]</strong>\n<strong>To avoid these harms, governments must end subsidies and other incentives that today exist for the burning of wood whether from their forests or others. The European Union needs to stop treating the burning of biomass as carbon neutral in its renewable energy standards and in its emissions trading system.</strong>\n‚ÄúGlobal Markets for Biomass Energy are Devastating US Forests‚Äù (2019)\n<a href=\"https://www.dogwoodalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Biomass-Investigation-Booklet-2019.pdf\">Investigation booklet into the sourcing of wood biomass from Southern US forests</a> by the world‚Äôs largest wood pellet producer, Enviva. This wood is being transported from the Southern US to burn in UK &amp; European power stations, including Drax\n<strong>Despite the claims of the industry, the independent reporting shows a disturbing pattern: wood pellets burned by Drax and others come from wood that is harvested from native hardwood forests in an area designated as a global biodiversity hotspot.</strong> They also spotlight the vast quantities of whole trees and other large-diameter wood‚Äî biomass feedstocks known to be high-carbon‚Äîthat are entering Enviva‚Äôs supply chain.\n**Not only is this devastating for these irreplaceable forests, but it‚Äôs worsening our Earth‚Äôs climate crisis. Multiple independent, peer-reviewed studies have determined that burning biomass from forests for electricity creates more carbon dioxide emissions than burning coal, and that increased carbon dioxide concentrations persist in the atmosphere for decades or more‚Äù‚Äù\nIn March 2019, investigators in North Carolina again tracked logging trucks from a mature hardwood forest to Enviva‚Äôs Northampton wood pellet mill. In January 2018, reporters from the UK Channel 4 News program Dispatches traveled to North Carolina to examine what is happening on the ground in the forests that have become ground zero for feeding Drax Power Station‚Äôs voracious demand for wood. <strong>The images from the Dispatches investigation tell a story of ecological devastation in the name of clean energy: a once majestic wetland forest clearcut to supply wood to Enviva, and ultimately to Drax.</strong></p>\n        </blockquote>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n\n  </article>\n</main>\n\n    <footer>\n  <div class=\"social\">\n    <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/axedraxlovetrees\"><img class=\"icon\" src=\"/assets/images/facebook.svg\" title=\"Facebook\" alt=\"Facebook page\"></a>\n    <a href=\"https://instagram.com/axe_drax\"><img class=\"icon\" src=\"/assets/images/instagram.svg\" alt=\"Instagram page\" title=\"Instagram\"></a>\n    <a href=\"https://t.me/axedrax\"><img class=\"icon\" src=\"/assets/images/telegram.svg\" alt=\"Telegram broardcast\" title=\"Telegram\"></a>\n    <a href=\"mailto:axedrax@pm.me\"><img class=\"icon\" src=\"/assets/images/email_icon.svg\" alt=\"Send email to axedrax@pm.me\" title=\"Email\"></a>\n  </div>\n</footer>\n\n  </body>\n</html>\n","excerpt":"","draft":false,"status":"Published","summary":"Pop in to talks and promotions hosted by Drax to educate fellow attendees.

This carbon dioxide was to be sold to pubs to ‚Äú<a href=\"https://www.drax.com/press_release/drax-help-keep-fizz-drinks-sector/\">help keep the fizz</a>‚Äù in beer.\n<a href=\"https://www.power-technology.com/features/draxs-carbon-capture/\">As of May</a>, the process was not working reliably, and no carbon dioxide was stored or sold. <a href=\"https://www.biofuelwatch.org.uk/2019/beccs-pilot-farce/\">This is not surprising</a>: C-Capture, though founded in 2009, had participated in no previous projects, obtained no patents and published no scientific studies. Instead of using a tried-and-tested solvent for capturing carbon, it chose to make its own, without disclosing any details. [‚Ä¶]\n<strong>The inclusion of BECCS into climate policies is dangerous: because BECCS is unlikely to work and, if it did, likely to result in extra carbon dioxide emissions from increased logging and land conversion.</strong>\n<a href=\"https://www.scotsman.com/news/opinion/burning-trees-will-not-save-us-climate-crisis-richard-dixon-3112293\">Burning trees will not save us from the climate crisis - Richard Dixon (26/1/21)</a>\nThe new report shows how <strong>BECCS is being used as a get out of jail card by governments and companies to do little about climate change but tell us all it‚Äôs going to be alright</strong>. BECCS is popular because countries around the world looked at their expected emissions, saw the widening gap between the trajectory they are on and the targets they are supposed to meet, and simply plugged in the magic unicorn of BECCS to fill the gap.\n<strong>[‚Ä¶] There is no fully-functioning BECCS scheme operating anywhere in the world.</strong>\nOf course, planting trees can be a great thing to do but <strong>to make BECCS work at scale you need a huge amount of plant material or timber. This would only be possible by destroying natural forests and converting large areas of arable land into monoculture plantations, displacing people, trashing nature and competing with food production.</strong> One estimate is that we would need twice as much land as is currently cultivated on a global scale and, according to an assessment in 2019, BECCS at massive scale would threaten an additional 150 million people with hunger.\n<a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/hdmmcnd0d1d2lq5/Scientist%20Letter%20to%20Biden%2C%20von%20der%20Leyen%2C%20Michel%2C%20Suga%20%26%20Moon%20%20Re.%20Forest%20Biomass%20%28February%2011%2C%202021%29.pdf?dl=0\">Letter Regarding Use of Forests for Bioenergy, 11/2/2021</a>\nAnd some related press releases:\n    - <a href=\"https://www.ecowatch.com/scientists-demand-stop-burning-trees-2650534163.html\">500+ Scientists Demand Stop to Tree Burning as Climate Solution</a>\n    - <a href=\"https://www.wwf.eu/?uNewsID=2128466\">From WWF</a>\nIn recent years, however, there has been a misguided move to cut down whole trees or to divert large portions of stem wood for bioenergy, releasing carbon that would otherwise stay locked up in forests.\nThe result of this additional wood harvest is a large initial increase in carbon emissions, creating a ‚Äúcarbon debt,‚Äù which increases over time as more trees are harvested for continuing bioenergy use. <strong>Regrowing trees and displacement of fossil fuels may eventually pay off this carbon debt, but regrowth takes time the world does not have to solve climate change.</strong>\n<strong>As numerous studies have shown, this burning of wood will increase warming for decades to centuries. That is true even when the wood replaces coal, oil or natural gas. [‚Ä¶]</strong>\n<strong>To avoid these harms, governments must end subsidies and other incentives that today exist for the burning of wood whether from their forests or others.

This would lead to more forest destruction and the conversion of huge areas of land to monoculture tree plantations in order to supply wood to burn in power stations <a href=\"https://www.scotsman.com/news/opinion/burning-trees-will-not-save-us-climate-crisis-richard-dixon-3112293\">1</a></li>\n      <li>For more information, <a href=\"https://www.foei.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Friends-of-the-Earth-International_BECCS_English.pdf\">please see page 2 of this report from Friends of the Earth International</a>: ‚Äú Providing enough biomass for BECCS, at the scale needed, would only be possible through deforestation, land-grabbing, and by converting large amounts of arable land into monoculture plantations. This means that BECCS will create competition for land among food producers, as more and more cropland will be dedicated to growing crops for fuel.

Last year, Drax announced that it wanted to go further and turn its plant into the ‚Äú<a href=\"https://www.drax.com/press_release/europes-first-bioenergy-carbon-capture-storage-pilot-now-underway/\">first carbon negative power station</a>‚Äù.\nIt entered into a partnership with startup company, <a href=\"https://www.c-capture.co.uk/\">C-Capture</a>, to try and capture one tonne of carbon dioxide daily. This carbon dioxide was to be sold to pubs to ‚Äú<a href=\"https://www.drax.com/press_release/drax-help-keep-fizz-drinks-sector/\">help keep the fizz</a>‚Äù in beer.\n<a href=\"https://www.power-technology.com/features/draxs-carbon-capture/\">As of May</a>, the process was not working reliably, and no carbon dioxide was stored or sold. <a href=\"https://www.biofuelwatch.org.uk/2019/beccs-pilot-farce/\">This is not surprising</a>: C-Capture, though founded in 2009, had participated in no previous projects, obtained no patents and published no scientific studies. Instead of using a tried-and-tested solvent for capturing carbon, it chose to make its own, without disclosing any details. [‚Ä¶]\n<strong>The inclusion of BECCS into climate policies is dangerous: because BECCS is unlikely to work and, if it did, likely to result in extra carbon dioxide emissions from increased logging and land conversion.</strong>\n<a href=\"https://www.scotsman.com/news/opinion/burning-trees-will-not-save-us-climate-crisis-richard-dixon-3112293\">Burning trees will not save us from the climate crisis - Richard Dixon (26/1/21)</a>\nThe new report shows how <strong>BECCS is being used as a get out of jail card by governments and companies to do little about climate change but tell us all it‚Äôs going to be alright</strong>. BECCS is popular because countries around the world looked at their expected emissions, saw the widening gap between the trajectory they are on and the targets they are supposed to meet, and simply plugged in the magic unicorn of BECCS to fill the gap.\n<strong>[‚Ä¶] There is no fully-functioning BECCS scheme operating anywhere in the world.</strong>\nOf course, planting trees can be a great thing to do but <strong>to make BECCS work at scale you need a huge amount of plant material or timber. This would only be possible by destroying natural forests and converting large areas of arable land into monoculture plantations, displacing people, trashing nature and competing with food production.</strong> One estimate is that we would need twice as much land as is currently cultivated on a global scale and, according to an assessment in 2019, BECCS at massive scale would threaten an additional 150 million people with hunger.\n<a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/hdmmcnd0d1d2lq5/Scientist%20Letter%20to%20Biden%2C%20von%20der%20Leyen%2C%20Michel%2C%20Suga%20%26%20Moon%20%20Re.%20Forest%20Biomass%20%28February%2011%2C%202021%29.pdf?dl=0\">Letter Regarding Use of Forests for Bioenergy, 11/2/2021</a>\nAnd some related press releases:\n    - <a href=\"https://www.ecowatch.com/scientists-demand-stop-burning-trees-2650534163.html\">500+ Scientists Demand Stop to Tree Burning as Climate Solution</a>\n    - <a href=\"https://www.wwf.eu/?uNewsID=2128466\">From WWF</a>\nIn recent years, however, there has been a misguided move to cut down whole trees or to divert large portions of stem wood for bioenergy, releasing carbon that would otherwise stay locked up in forests.\nThe result of this additional wood harvest is a large initial increase in carbon emissions, creating a ‚Äúcarbon debt,‚Äù which increases over time as more trees are harvested for continuing bioenergy use. <strong>Regrowing trees and displacement of fossil fuels may eventually pay off this carbon debt, but regrowth takes time the world does not have to solve climate change.</strong>\n<strong>As numerous studies have shown, this burning of wood will increase warming for decades to centuries. That is true even when the wood replaces coal, oil or natural gas. [‚Ä¶]</strong>\n<strong>To avoid these harms, governments must end subsidies and other incentives that today exist for the burning of wood whether from their forests or others. The European Union needs to stop treating the burning of biomass as carbon neutral in its renewable energy standards and in its emissions trading system.</strong>\n‚ÄúGlobal Markets for Biomass Energy are Devastating US Forests‚Äù (2019)\n<a href=\"https://www.dogwoodalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Biomass-Investigation-Booklet-2019.pdf\">Investigation booklet into the sourcing of wood biomass from Southern US forests</a> by the world‚Äôs largest wood pellet producer, Enviva. This wood is being transported from the Southern US to burn in UK &amp; European power stations, including Drax\n<strong>Despite the claims of the industry, the independent reporting shows a disturbing pattern: wood pellets burned by Drax and others come from wood that is harvested from native hardwood forests in an area designated as a global biodiversity hotspot.</strong> They also spotlight the vast quantities of whole trees and other large-diameter wood‚Äî biomass feedstocks known to be high-carbon‚Äîthat are entering Enviva‚Äôs supply chain.\n**Not only is this devastating for these irreplaceable forests, but it‚Äôs worsening our Earth‚Äôs climate crisis. Multiple independent, peer-reviewed studies have determined that burning biomass from forests for electricity creates more carbon dioxide emissions than burning coal, and that increased carbon dioxide concentrations persist in the atmosphere for decades or more‚Äù‚Äù\nIn March 2019, investigators in North Carolina again tracked logging trucks from a mature hardwood forest to Enviva‚Äôs Northampton wood pellet mill.

Last year, Drax announced that it wanted to go further and turn its plant into the ‚Äú<a href=\"https://www.drax.com/press_release/europes-first-bioenergy-carbon-capture-storage-pilot-now-underway/\">first carbon negative power station</a>‚Äù.\nIt entered into a partnership with startup company, <a href=\"https://www.c-capture.co.uk/\">C-Capture</a>, to try and capture one tonne of carbon dioxide daily. This carbon dioxide was to be sold to pubs to ‚Äú<a href=\"https://www.drax.com/press_release/drax-help-keep-fizz-drinks-sector/\">help keep the fizz</a>‚Äù in beer.\n<a href=\"https://www.power-technology.com/features/draxs-carbon-capture/\">As of May</a>, the process was not working reliably, and no carbon dioxide was stored or sold. <a href=\"https://www.biofuelwatch.org.uk/2019/beccs-pilot-farce/\">This is not surprising</a>: C-Capture, though founded in 2009, had participated in no previous projects, obtained no patents and published no scientific studies. Instead of using a tried-and-tested solvent for capturing carbon, it chose to make its own, without disclosing any details. [‚Ä¶]\n<strong>The inclusion of BECCS into climate policies is dangerous: because BECCS is unlikely to work and, if it did, likely to result in extra carbon dioxide emissions from increased logging and land conversion.</strong>\n<a href=\"https://www.scotsman.com/news/opinion/burning-trees-will-not-save-us-climate-crisis-richard-dixon-3112293\">Burning trees will not save us from the climate crisis - Richard Dixon (26/1/21)</a>\nThe new report shows how <strong>BECCS is being used as a get out of jail card by governments and companies to do little about climate change but tell us all it‚Äôs going to be alright</strong>. BECCS is popular because countries around the world looked at their expected emissions, saw the widening gap between the trajectory they are on and the targets they are supposed to meet, and simply plugged in the magic unicorn of BECCS to fill the gap.\n<strong>[‚Ä¶] There is no fully-functioning BECCS scheme operating anywhere in the world.</strong>\nOf course, planting trees can be a great thing to do but <strong>to make BECCS work at scale you need a huge amount of plant material or timber. This would only be possible by destroying natural forests and converting large areas of arable land into monoculture plantations, displacing people, trashing nature and competing with food production.</strong> One estimate is that we would need twice as much land as is currently cultivated on a global scale and, according to an assessment in 2019, BECCS at massive scale would threaten an additional 150 million people with hunger.\n<a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/hdmmcnd0d1d2lq5/Scientist%20Letter%20to%20Biden%2C%20von%20der%20Leyen%2C%20Michel%2C%20Suga%20%26%20Moon%20%20Re.%20Forest%20Biomass%20%28February%2011%2C%202021%29.pdf?dl=0\">Letter Regarding Use of Forests for Bioenergy, 11/2/2021</a>\nAnd some related press releases:\n    - <a href=\"https://www.ecowatch.com/scientists-demand-stop-burning-trees-2650534163.html\">500+ Scientists Demand Stop to Tree Burning as Climate Solution</a>\n    - <a href=\"https://www.wwf.eu/?uNewsID=2128466\">From WWF</a>\nIn recent years, however, there has been a misguided move to cut down whole trees or to divert large portions of stem wood for bioenergy, releasing carbon that would otherwise stay locked up in forests.\nThe result of this additional wood harvest is a large initial increase in carbon emissions, creating a ‚Äúcarbon debt,‚Äù which increases over time as more trees are harvested for continuing bioenergy use. <strong>Regrowing trees and displacement of fossil fuels may eventually pay off this carbon debt, but regrowth takes time the world does not have to solve climate change.</strong>\n<strong>As numerous studies have shown, this burning of wood will increase warming for decades to centuries. That is true even when the wood replaces coal, oil or natural gas. [‚Ä¶]</strong>\n<strong>To avoid these harms, governments must end subsidies and other incentives that today exist for the burning of wood whether from their forests or others. The European Union needs to stop treating the burning of biomass as carbon neutral in its renewable energy standards and in its emissions trading system.</strong>\n‚ÄúGlobal Markets for Biomass Energy are Devastating US Forests‚Äù (2019)\n<a href=\"https://www.dogwoodalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Biomass-Investigation-Booklet-2019.pdf\">Investigation booklet into the sourcing of wood biomass from Southern US forests</a> by the world‚Äôs largest wood pellet producer, Enviva. This wood is being transported from the Southern US to burn in UK &amp; European power stations, including Drax\n<strong>Despite the claims of the industry, the independent reporting shows a disturbing pattern: wood pellets burned by Drax and others come from wood that is harvested from native hardwood forests in an area designated as a global biodiversity hotspot.</strong> They also spotlight the vast quantities of whole trees and other large-diameter wood‚Äî biomass feedstocks known to be high-carbon‚Äîthat are entering Enviva‚Äôs supply chain.\n**Not only is this devastating for these irreplaceable forests, but it‚Äôs worsening our Earth‚Äôs climate crisis. Multiple independent, peer-reviewed studies have determined that burning biomass from forests for electricity creates more carbon dioxide emissions than burning coal, and that increased carbon dioxide concentrations persist in the atmosphere for decades or more‚Äù‚Äù\nIn March 2019, investigators in North Carolina again tracked logging trucks from a mature hardwood forest to Enviva‚Äôs Northampton wood pellet mill. In January 2018, reporters from the UK Channel 4 News program Dispatches traveled to North Carolina to examine what is happening on the ground in the forests that have become ground zero for feeding Drax Power Station‚Äôs voracious demand for wood. <strong>The images from the Dispatches investigation tell a story of ecological devastation in the name of clean energy: a once majestic wetland forest clearcut to supply wood to Enviva, and ultimately to Drax.</strong></p>\n        </blockquote>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n","next":{"id":"/actions/social-media","categories":[],"title":"Social Media","previous":{"id":"/actions/zoom","categories":[],"title":"Join Zoom calls","tags":null,"collection":"actions","path":"_actions/zoom.md","date":"2022-11-07 14:36:47 +0000","url":"/actions/zoom/","relative_path":"_actions/zoom.md","draft":false,"status":"Published","summary":"Pop in to talks and promotions hosted by Drax to educate fellow attendees.

Last year, Drax announced that it wanted to go further and turn its plant into the ‚Äú<a href=\"https://www.drax.com/press_release/europes-first-bioenergy-carbon-capture-storage-pilot-now-underway/\">first carbon negative power station</a>‚Äù.\nIt entered into a partnership with startup company, <a href=\"https://www.c-capture.co.uk/\">C-Capture</a>, to try and capture one tonne of carbon dioxide daily. This carbon dioxide was to be sold to pubs to ‚Äú<a href=\"https://www.drax.com/press_release/drax-help-keep-fizz-drinks-sector/\">help keep the fizz</a>‚Äù in beer.\n<a href=\"https://www.power-technology.com/features/draxs-carbon-capture/\">As of May</a>, the process was not working reliably, and no carbon dioxide was stored or sold. <a href=\"https://www.biofuelwatch.org.uk/2019/beccs-pilot-farce/\">This is not surprising</a>: C-Capture, though founded in 2009, had participated in no previous projects, obtained no patents and published no scientific studies. Instead of using a tried-and-tested solvent for capturing carbon, it chose to make its own, without disclosing any details. [‚Ä¶]\n<strong>The inclusion of BECCS into climate policies is dangerous: because BECCS is unlikely to work and, if it did, likely to result in extra carbon dioxide emissions from increased logging and land conversion.</strong>\n<a href=\"https://www.scotsman.com/news/opinion/burning-trees-will-not-save-us-climate-crisis-richard-dixon-3112293\">Burning trees will not save us from the climate crisis - Richard Dixon (26/1/21)</a>\nThe new report shows how <strong>BECCS is being used as a get out of jail card by governments and companies to do little about climate change but tell us all it‚Äôs going to be alright</strong>. BECCS is popular because countries around the world looked at their expected emissions, saw the widening gap between the trajectory they are on and the targets they are supposed to meet, and simply plugged in the magic unicorn of BECCS to fill the gap.\n<strong>[‚Ä¶] There is no fully-functioning BECCS scheme operating anywhere in the world.</strong>\nOf course, planting trees can be a great thing to do but <strong>to make BECCS work at scale you need a huge amount of plant material or timber. This would only be possible by destroying natural forests and converting large areas of arable land into monoculture plantations, displacing people, trashing nature and competing with food production.</strong> One estimate is that we would need twice as much land as is currently cultivated on a global scale and, according to an assessment in 2019, BECCS at massive scale would threaten an additional 150 million people with hunger.\n<a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/hdmmcnd0d1d2lq5/Scientist%20Letter%20to%20Biden%2C%20von%20der%20Leyen%2C%20Michel%2C%20Suga%20%26%20Moon%20%20Re.%20Forest%20Biomass%20%28February%2011%2C%202021%29.pdf?dl=0\">Letter Regarding Use of Forests for Bioenergy, 11/2/2021</a>\nAnd some related press releases:\n    - <a href=\"https://www.ecowatch.com/scientists-demand-stop-burning-trees-2650534163.html\">500+ Scientists Demand Stop to Tree Burning as Climate Solution</a>\n    - <a href=\"https://www.wwf.eu/?uNewsID=2128466\">From WWF</a>\nIn recent years, however, there has been a misguided move to cut down whole trees or to divert large portions of stem wood for bioenergy, releasing carbon that would otherwise stay locked up in forests.\nThe result of this additional wood harvest is a large initial increase in carbon emissions, creating a ‚Äúcarbon debt,‚Äù which increases over time as more trees are harvested for continuing bioenergy use. <strong>Regrowing trees and displacement of fossil fuels may eventually pay off this carbon debt, but regrowth takes time the world does not have to solve climate change.</strong>\n<strong>As numerous studies have shown, this burning of wood will increase warming for decades to centuries. That is true even when the wood replaces coal, oil or natural gas. [‚Ä¶]</strong>\n<strong>To avoid these harms, governments must end subsidies and other incentives that today exist for the burning of wood whether from their forests or others. The European Union needs to stop treating the burning of biomass as carbon neutral in its renewable energy standards and in its emissions trading system.</strong>\n‚ÄúGlobal Markets for Biomass Energy are Devastating US Forests‚Äù (2019)\n<a href=\"https://www.dogwoodalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Biomass-Investigation-Booklet-2019.pdf\">Investigation booklet into the sourcing of wood biomass from Southern US forests</a> by the world‚Äôs largest wood pellet producer, Enviva. This wood is being transported from the Southern US to burn in UK &amp; European power stations, including Drax\n<strong>Despite the claims of the industry, the independent reporting shows a disturbing pattern: wood pellets burned by Drax and others come from wood that is harvested from native hardwood forests in an area designated as a global biodiversity hotspot.</strong> They also spotlight the vast quantities of whole trees and other large-diameter wood‚Äî biomass feedstocks known to be high-carbon‚Äîthat are entering Enviva‚Äôs supply chain.\n**Not only is this devastating for these irreplaceable forests, but it‚Äôs worsening our Earth‚Äôs climate crisis. Multiple independent, peer-reviewed studies have determined that burning biomass from forests for electricity creates more carbon dioxide emissions than burning coal, and that increased carbon dioxide concentrations persist in the atmosphere for decades or more‚Äù‚Äù\nIn March 2019, investigators in North Carolina again tracked logging trucks from a mature hardwood forest to Enviva‚Äôs Northampton wood pellet mill. In January 2018, reporters from the UK Channel 4 News program Dispatches traveled to North Carolina to examine what is happening on the ground in the forests that have become ground zero for feeding Drax Power Station‚Äôs voracious demand for wood. <strong>The images from the Dispatches investigation tell a story of ecological devastation in the name of clean energy: a once majestic wetland forest clearcut to supply wood to Enviva, and ultimately to Drax.</strong></p>\n        </blockquote>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n\n  </article>\n</main>\n\n    <footer>\n  <div class=\"social\">\n    <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/axedraxlovetrees\"><img class=\"icon\" src=\"/assets/images/facebook.svg\" title=\"Facebook\" alt=\"Facebook page\"></a>\n    <a href=\"https://instagram.com/axe_drax\"><img class=\"icon\" src=\"/assets/images/instagram.svg\" alt=\"Instagram page\" title=\"Instagram\"></a>\n    <a href=\"https://t.me/axedrax\"><img class=\"icon\" src=\"/assets/images/telegram.svg\" alt=\"Telegram broardcast\" title=\"Telegram\"></a>\n    <a href=\"mailto:axedrax@pm.me\"><img class=\"icon\" src=\"/assets/images/email_icon.svg\" alt=\"Send email to axedrax@pm.me\" title=\"Email\"></a>\n  </div>\n</footer>\n\n  </body>\n</html>\n","excerpt":"","draft":false,"status":"Published","summary":"Pop in to talks and promotions hosted by Drax to educate fellow attendees.
