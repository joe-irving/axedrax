Coffee is facing charges with a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. Today, Diana Warner attends York Magistrates Court to plead not-guilty to obstructing a train on December 12th.</p>

<p>Dr Warner is a retired GP from Bristol. She has marched, emailed her MP, written letters, signed petitions, become active in organisations working for peace and for climate. She has even stood for election for the local council and as an MP candidate in Filton and Bradley Stoke. In her words, “none of these things have been effective for change”.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Drax power station is the largest carbon emitter in the UK, while masquerading as a source of green electricity. Drax chews up wood pellets by the mega train load, and is responsible for destruction of natural forests and wildlife. At the same time it’s not profitable, needing 800 million pounds in subsidies from the taxpayer last year alone.</p>

  <p>As a doctor, I am very concerned about people’s health. We know the dangers of carbon emissions causing climate change. As well as this danger, dust from the wood pellets themselves are making people working at Drax ill, causing cancer and respiratory problems. In the vicinity of factories abroad that provide the wood pellets, people are suffering from the effects of toxic chemicals as well as the wood smoke pollution.</p>

  <p>On the one hand we subsidise the company and on the other hand the state, through the health and safety executive, are taking them to court for not protecting the health of workers. It doesn’t make sense.</p>

  <p>Today I am in York magistrates court, on a charge of obstructing a train. I was trying to protect the workers at Drax, and all our children. I will be saying to the people in the courtroom: it’s time for the justice system to do a proper job and protect us.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Dr Diana Warner, in court today at York Magistrates’ Court.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Axe Drax is calling on the government to:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Tell the Truth</strong>: Governments and corporations must be honest: biomass causes irreparable damage to the health of people and our life support systems. It is not a clean source of fuel, it is time to stop the greenwashing.</li>
  <li><strong>Defund Biomass</strong>: Remove the £billions in subsidies given to Drax and other biomass power stations around the UK. This money is used to fund death and destruction around the world, harming POC and poorer communities the most whilst corporations profit. If we stop the money we stop the train of destruction.</li>
  <li><strong>Fund Community Solutions</strong>: The £billions given to biomass should be used to fund a just transition: furlough, retrain and transfer workers in the biomass industry; invest in education, affordable housing and health; fund genuine renewable energy; develop a plan of degrowth moving away from profit motives fuelling the climate crisis towards community based solutions.</li>
</ol>

<p>This comes less than a fortnight after two Axe Drax members were arrested for dousing the department of Business Energy and Industrial Strategy with orange paint with a modified fire extinguisher, to protest the billions of pounds they give to Drax and biomass. [12]</p>

<p>Drax is the UK’s single largest carbon emitter [1], yet received £832 million in renewable subsidies last year [2] which is more than £2 million per day. In the last year they were removed from the Green Energy Index [3], despite this, they continue to receive huge amounts of renewable subsidies. Biomass is one of the most carbon intensive forms of biofuel [4], yet this is ignored by politicians so Drax can be called the main supplier of ‘renewable energy’ in the UK [11].</p>

<p>Per unit of energy generated, biomass is worse than coal [5], producing 40-60% more carbon than modern coal stations. We cannot allow this inefficient and destructive form of fuel to continue being classed as renewable. Their pellet production site in Amite, Mississippi, was fined $2.5 million in 2021 [6] for violating environmental regulations, receiving the largest known fine a biomass company has ever had. This pellet production plant was emitting over 3x the legally allowed amount of VOCs [7] (volatile organic compounds). VOCs are linked to ground level ozone and smog, impairing lung function, triggering asthma and put children, elderly and those with existing respiratory conditions at risk.</p>

<p>Axe Drax and many other groups have been peacefully campaigning against biomass for years. We have signed petitions, written letters, held protests, lobbied decision makers, but this destructive industry is being allowed to continue funded by public money. Harm is being felt right now by the Black, Indigenous, and People of Colour (BIPOC) people on the front lines of Drax’s business of destruction. Our climate is on the brink of tipping points that would put every society at risk of collapse, with those in the global south already feeling disastrous, irreparable loss of and damage to life, home, stability and knowledge.</p>

He has now scaled the entrance. This is the beginning of a series of protests today against Drax Group on their annual general meeting, as campaigners gather in Liverpool, Leeds, York, Hull and outside Drax’s AGM in London.</p>

<p>Just weeks after Extinction Rebellion scientists targeted BEIS for their financing of fossil fuels, Axe Drax is here to demonstrate that it’s renewable policies are dangerously harmful too. They give huge amounts of subsidies to the ecocidal biomass industry, particularly Drax Power Station. By 2027 the biomass industry as a whole will have received £13billion in renewable subsidies, and £10billion of that has gone directly to Drax. BEIS is funding pollution and destruction around the world.</p>

<p>Drax is the UKs <a href="https://www.drax.com/sustainability/carbon-emissions/#carbon-emissions">single largest carbon emitter</a>, yet received <a href="https://ember-climate.org/commentary/2021/02/25/drax-biomass-subsidies/">£832 million in renewable subsidies last year</a> which is more than £2 million per day. In the last year they were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/oct/19/drax-dropped-from-index-of-green-energy-firms-amid-biomass-doubts">removed from the Green Energy Index</a>, despite this, they continue to receive huge amounts of renewable subsidies. Biomass is one of the <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aaac88/pdf">most carbon intensive forms of biofuel</a>, yet this is ignored by politicians so Drax can be called the <a href="https://www.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Drax_AR2021_2022-03-07.final_.pdf">main supplier of ‘renewable energy’ in the UK</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The criminal injustice of Drax fills me with despair and needs to stop. Drax power station is accelerating the climate crises, whilst being labelled as the solution, costing taxpayers in their energy bills and is in court with the HSE for their work conditions. There are so many layers of injustice in this, it’s surreal they still receive public money. The government energy strategy must see through the bullshit of Drax and cancel the funding.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The person who doused the department building in paint</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Axe Drax is calling on the government to:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Tell the Truth</strong>: Governments and corporations must be honest: biomass causes irreparable damage to the health of people and our life support systems. It is not a clean source of fuel, it is time to stop the greenwashing.</li>
  <li><strong>Defund Biomass</strong>: Remove the £billions in subsidies given to Drax and other biomass power stations around the UK.

</ol>

<p>In the BEIS November 2021 Biomass Policy Statement, they suggest that biomass has a core role to play in decarbonisation. Per unit of energy generated, biomass is <a href="https://www.pfpi.net/carbon-emissions">worse than coal</a>, producing 40-60% more carbon than modern coal stations. We cannot allow this inefficient and destructive form of fuel to continue being classed as renewable. Research has demonstrated that it takes <a href="https://ww2.rspb.org.uk/images/biomass_report_tcm9-326672.pdf">40-100 years</a> to reabsorb the carbon emitted from burning trees for fuel. The most recent IPCC report suggests that we have 3-4 years to avert climate catastrophe, 100 years is a death sentence.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are looking at millions of people dying at an increasing rate across the global south, and communities are directly being harmed now by the insane biomass industry that this government funds. By 2027 Drax will have received £10billion in renewable subsidies, coming straight out of our fuel bills and given to them by BEIS. This is a disgusting misuse of public money. We have to stop burning trees now.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Rosie, 24, another member of Axe Drax involved</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Drax is currently asking for more public money to fund BECCS, which is estimated to cost <a href="https://ember-climate.org/app/uploads/2022/01/The-cost-of-Drax-BECCS.pdf">over £31billion</a>. BECCS has never been shown to work on the scale required to make biomass carbon neutral. Even if BECCS did work, studies have found that demand for biomass would increase to such a degree that we would face <a href="https://oxfamilibrary.openrepository.com/bitstream/handle/10546/621205/bp-net-zero-land-food-equity-030821-en.pdf?sequence=1">global food shortages and desertification</a>. BEIS cannot continue funding climate catastrophe.</p>

<p>Axe Drax and many other groups have been peacefully campaigning against biomass for years. We have signed petitions, written letters, held protests, lobbied decision makers, but this destructive industry is being allowed to continue funded by public money. Harm is being felt right now by the BIPOC people on the front lines of Drax’s business of destruction. Our climate is on the brink of tipping points that would put every society at risk of collapse, with those in the global south already feeling disastrous, irreparable loss of and damage to life, home, stability and knowledge.</p>

Dressed in bright orange hi vis and carrying a Extinction Rebellion flag the activist has climbed on top of the train to send a clear message to COP26: stop the fell. Banners emblazoned with the words ‘Forests Are Not Fuel’ and ‘Moratorium on Tree Felling’ line the tracks. The activists have created a visually striking and physically disruptive demonstration against the ecocidal use of biofuels.</p>

<p>Police have now arrived at the scene and the protestor remains in good spirits and committed to why they’ve felt the need to take this action.</p>

<p>This trainline only goes to Drax so no other trains have been impacted.</p>

<p>Coffee, currently on top of the train: We need to keep the trees in the ground, we need a U-turn on the decision to phase out deforestation by 2030, we need to slam on the breaks. Halt the felling. Bring a moratorium on tree felling for six months whilst a plan is made for a future world economy.</p>

<p>This follows a wave of anti-biofuel and Drax specific protests at COP26 where protestors have been standing up against the destructive greenwashing biofuel industry [15]. Drax Power Station, located in Yorkshire, burns 12 million tonnes of trees every year [2]. Despite being legally classified as ‘renewable’ by the UK government, Drax remains the largest carbon emitter in the UK [1,3], taking advantage of a carbon accounting loophole [4]. In 2019 Drax emitted almost 13 million tonnes of CO₂ from burning wood, and yet over the last year Drax received £832 million in ‘renewable subsidies’ [5], and are expecting to receive billions more.</p>

<p>This is a grave misuse of public money and just one example of the destructive biofuel industry.</p>

<p>The protestors are calling for:</p>

<ol>
  <li>An international moratorium on all tree felling for 6 months whilst a plan is devised to adequately tackle deforestation and dismantle the biofuel industry</li>
  <li>Furlough for all impacted workers: COVID19 demonstrated that it is possible for governments to take drastic action when required; which the climate and ecological crisis urgently requires</li>
  <li>Stop the Lies: end what is possibly the most comprehensive and dangerous greenwashing campaign the UK has seen</li>
</ol>

<p>The UKs environment minister, Zac Goldsmith, acknowledged concerns that large-scale burning of wood for energy in UK power stations harms forests and produces carbon emissions [14]. His admission came after the Daily Telegraph revealed that Britain will continue to burn the equivalent of 25 million trees a year [13], despite a pledge from the UK Government and other world leaders last week at COP26 to help end the destruction of forests [9].</p>

<p>Research demonstrates that the biofuel industry is more carbon intensive that coal [16] and yet is posed as an ecologically sustainable solution by policy makers. This is greenwashing, pure and simple. Coming off the back of COP26 where we have seen a truly astounding amount of greenwashing and representation of corporate interests [12], governments around the world seem to show little intention on stopping the greenwash. The COP26’s Global Forest Finance [6] pledge puts aside USD$12 billion for reforestation, yet the UK government plan to spend over $1 billion more than that on propping up Drax’s forest burning project [7].</p>

<p>Biomass production harms both people and planet. Aside from being highly carbon intensive, deforestation is linked to an increase in flooding, soil degradation, biodiversity and habitat loss, noise and air pollution for local communities and environmental racism [17].</p>

<p>It is time we demand an end to corporate and government greenwashing.</p>

<p>We are starting to see small steps towards an end to deforestation, with British Columbia recently banning logging in an ecologically sensitive area along the US border [8]. However, logging continues across Canada, with wood pellets being shipped from Canada to the UK for Drax to incinerate. This demonstrates one thing - where there is political will it is possible to stop deforestation. However that political will is currently severely lacking.</p>

<p>World leaders at COP26 initially pledged to end deforestation by 2030 [9], which firstly is far too late, and secondly, countries such as Brazil (the worlds second largest biofuel producer [10]) have already begun to backtrack on this agreement before the conference is even over [11]. Furthermore, the previous deal agreed in 2014 on deforestation has ‘failed to slow deforestation at all’ [9].</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Drax is literally burning away some of our last hopes of ensuring we have a liveable planet, with 3 to 4 years to avert this crisis we can’t afford to be burning forests. I am terrified of a future in climate breakdown, and horrified at the effects of this crisis ripping through the global south. We’ve run out of time, and we must act as fast as we can.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Joe, 21</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Given that the UK government has pledged to end deforestation by 2030 and pursue a restoration to forest loss and land degradation we believe it is our duty as active citizens to help them with this goal. It is our view that a good first step would be to stop burning trees for fuel. Forests are not fuel. This is why we believe we are left with little choice other than to take action to prevent further planetary destruction.</p>

summary of the information that was prepared.</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="be-kind">Be kind</h1>

<p>People taking part in remote actions are asked to treat the people on the phone or over email and social media with respect. Please do not harass or threaten anyone over the phone during this action, as this is not necessary and can put you at risk of charge. Our job is to educate people on the harm of large scale biomass projects. Making calls to be annoying is not helpful for the following numbers, as you will most likely just be talking to a secretary or possibly a call centre worker.</p>

<p>If however, you manage to in contact with anyone who actually has power be as
annoying as you like!</p>

<h1 id="briefing">Briefing</h1>

<ol>
  <li>For each contact, there is a main script, a nuance document and a left message.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Main Script</strong>: skeleton guidance for your call. From “hello” through to ending the conversation.</li>
      <li><strong>Nuance document</strong>: Link to key information about the campaign and Drax facts. Divided thematically.</li>
      <li><strong>Left message</strong>: Suggested voicemail message to leave contacts who don’t answer your call.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Follow up with an email.
    <ul>
      <li>Make sure to BCC <a href="mailto;axedrax@pm.me">axedrax@pm.me</a>, so in theory we
  can predict responses in future - or center actions around them.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="tips-do">Tips. DO…</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>DO know the script</strong>: familiarise yourself with the content and flow. Read it out to yourself. You can even try as a role play with someone you trust (this could be a friend or a member of your local XR group/organisation). This is a way to build confidence before the action :)</li>
  <li><strong>DO strive for connection</strong>: Try to imagine they’re sitting across from you. Ask questions and try to create a natural “back and forth”. The better you know the script, the easier this will be.</li>
  <li><strong>DO refer to #AxeDrax and affiliated groups in the third person</strong>: People are more likely to be persuaded by the aims and purpose of the action/campaign, rather than by a stranger telling them how to feel.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="tips-dont-">Tips. DON’T …</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>DON’T worry if you go off script</strong>: in fact we encourage riffing on it. However, there are a few pitfalls to avoid such as…</li>
  <li><strong>DON’T make assumptions</strong> about their age, race, gender, or their attitudes about Drax.</li>
  <li><strong>DON’T debate or argue</strong>: our task is to educate and not to annoy or anger anybody. If someone is genuinely asking questions, do your best to answer them. However, if someone is clearly disagreeing with you and trying to argue or debate, don’t engage. It’s always OK to say, “I have a lot of calls left to make today so I do have to go. Thanks for your time”.</li>

<p>Good morning/afternoon. This is _____ and I am a constituent of _____. I’m reaching out to you to discuss the harmful effect Drax Power Station’s tree burning is having on communities in the UK, in the hopes that you can help to reduce biomass subsidies by writing to Alok Sharma and Kwasi Karteng. If you’d like to hear about this please return my call on [Number] before 5pm today. Thank you.</p>

<h3 id="main-script">Main script</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Good morning/Good afternoon, is <strong>[YOUR MP]</strong> available?</li>
  <li>Hello _______ . This is _______ calling on behalf of the #AxeDrax campaign. I am a constituent of <strong>[YOUR CONSTITUENCY]</strong>. I’m phoning because I am very concerned about the climate crisis and I am particularly worried about Drax Power Station’s fossil fuel and tree burning. Are you aware that Drax Power Station is the greatest emitter of CO<sub>2</sub> in the UK?
    <ol>
      <li><strong>(IF NO)</strong> OK. Although Drax is phasing out coal, their power stations are being converted into biomass plants, with the false claims that this is renewable energy, when in truth burning trees for energy contributes more CO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere than coal per unit of electricity produced. <em>Continue to 3</em></li>
      <li><strong>(IF YES)</strong> That’s good to know that you are aware that the biomass industry isn’t as clean as Drax claims. <em>Continue to 3</em></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Would you be willing to hear more about how Drax is harming communities in the UK?
    <ol>
      <li><strong>(IF NO)</strong> No problem. I think it’s really important that we remove Drax’s biofuel subsidies, and redirect those towards truly renewable sources of energy, such as solar and wind, instead of using them to transport wood pellets across the planet. It would be great if you could write to the BEIS ministers Alok Sharma and Kwasi Karteng, ask Parliamentary Questions about biofuel subsidies, and perhaps request a parliamentary debate around the issue.</li>
      <li><strong>(IF YES)</strong> Great. You might already know that the beginning of Drax’s biomass production is in the Southern USA, where large areas of forests are torn down and pelletised in factories. This process harms the communities because it takes away nature and increases pollution, ultimately having a negative effect on health. In the UK, these wood pellets come into a number of ports, one of the biggest being Liverpool’s Peel Ports. Communities in this area experience air pollution as a result of this, and Highways England are also planning to destroy the much loved Rimrose Valley to build a road that will increase transportation of wood pellets to Drax’s Power Station in Yorkshire, despite the claim that it will reduce traffic. This is one of several examples of communities that were never given a choice. Would you be willing to use your authority as an MP to change this?
        <ol>
          <li><strong>(IF YES)</strong> Please could you write to Alok Sharma and Kwasi Karteng and ask them to switch biomass subsidies to genuine renewables under the Levy Control Framework, ask Parliamentary Questions about biofuel subsidies, and perhaps request a parliamentary debate around the issue. We can send you <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DYlkCzT29UNlhdWeM9ceQBJPqPFXlN4Z/view?usp=sharing">a briefing</a> on this issue, please could you forward any replies back to my email. Thanks again for listening, have a good day.</li>
          <li><strong>(IF NO).</strong> That’s OK. Thank you for talking to me, have a good day.</li>
        </ol>

<ol>
  <li>Good morning/Good afternoon, is Alok Sharma available?

    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Hello _______ . This is _______ calling on behalf of the #AxeDrax campaign. I am calling to talk to you about Drax Power Station. Are you aware that Drax Power Station is the greatest emitter of CO<sub>2</sub> in the UK?
    <ol>
      <li><strong>(IF YES)</strong> - That’s good to know _(Skip to <strong>3</strong>) _</li>
      <li><strong>(IF NO)</strong> - No problem (<strong>Explain about Drax, use the FAQ document</strong>)</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>That’s good to know that you are aware that the biomass industry isn’t as clean as Drax claims. Would you be willing to hear more about how Drax is harming communities in the UK and USA?

This is one of several examples of communities that were never given a choice. Could you take these issues to Alok Sharma and ask him to move subsidies for biomass to genuine renewables under the Levy Control Framework. <em>(ask for direct email to send details on)</em></li>

<h3 id="left-message-2">Left message</h3>

<p>Good morning/afternoon. My name is _____ and I am calling from the Axe Drax campaign.  Could you please get back to me on <em>[Number]</em> about whether Yeo Valley would consider not sourcing its electricity through Haven Power, and fully switch to a provider that does not pollute communities?</p>

<h3 id="main-script-2">Main Script</h3>

  <li>
    <p>Hello _______ . This is _______ calling on behalf of the #AxeDrax campaign. It has come to our attention that Yeo Valley’s energy comes from Haven Power which is owned by Drax. Are you aware that Drax Power Station is the greatest emitter of CO<sub>2</sub> in the UK? \</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>(IF NO).</strong> OK. Although Drax is phasing out coal, their power stations are being converted into biomass plants, with the false claims that this is renewable energy, when in truth it contributes more CO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere than coal for the same amount of electricity. Would you be willing to hear more about how Drax is harming communities in the UK and the US?
    <ol>
      <li><strong>(IF NO)</strong> No problem. I think it is really important that companies like Yeo Valley stop supporting companies like Haven Power, Drax, and Enviva which take part in logging operations in the Southern USA that contribute to air, water and noise pollution in predominantly Black, indigenous and low-income communities - all hidden under lies about renewable energy. Would you be willing to write to me about whether Yeo Valley will continue to support the harmful, polluting biomass industry? <em>(give them your contact details if not hung up yet)</em></li>
      <li><strong>(IF YES)</strong> Great. You might already know that the beginning of Drax’s biomass production is mostly in the Southern USA, where large areas of forests are torn down and pelletised in factories. This process contributes to air, water and noise pollution that hurts predominantly poorer and non-white communities. In the UK, these wood pellets come into a number of ports, one of the biggest being Liverpool’s Peel Ports. People in the area experience harmful air pollution due to this, and Highways England are also planning to destroy the much loved Rimrose Valley to build a road that is likely to increase transportation of wood pellets to Drax’s Power Station in Yorkshire, despite the claim that it will reduce traffic. This is one of several examples of communities that were never given a choice. Can you see the harm that Drax’s wood burning electricity is causing? <em>(hypothetical, skip straight to 3.)</em></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>(IF YES)</strong> As YeoValley is an ethical company that promotes the importance of biodiversity are you going to switch from Haven Power to a genuine renewable energy supplier?
    <ol>
      <li><strong>(IF YES)</strong> Could you put that in writing to me on [your email]? <em>(forward this to <a href="mailto:axedrax@pm.me">axedrax@pm.me</a> if possible)</em></li>
      <li><strong>(IF NO)</strong> Drax Power Station fuels forest destruction that ultimately will make all of our lives worse.

    <p>While many of us have been enjoying the respite of some clean air, those living near Drax Power Station in the UK and near its pellet supplies factories in the USA have not had the same break.  Drax continues to pollute communities and increase the chance of heart disease, respiratory illness and cancer. For the sake of people’s live, it is time to #AxeDrax and move the ridiculous £789.5 million of “renewable energy” subsidies which Drax received in 2019 to genuine renewables that don’t harm communities and provide secure green jobs.  #CutCarbonNotForests <br />

    <p>"When I heard about Enviva coming to Richmond County, it felt like my heart dropped in my stomach. Nobody educated our little town here - not on the Perdue Chicken Plant, on the CSX railway, or on the Enviva wood pellet plant.  "My hope for my community is that we all join together and fight together and win the biomass challenge. Winning would make me feel so good. It would allow me to be able to go to another community and help them. We won't stop when we win - we will keep going." Debra David <br />

<p>Just a few compiled questions, please email us with more!</p>

<h3 id="tree-burning">Tree burning</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Is it normal for Green Energy suppliers to be given <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-york-north-yorkshire-56130166">$2.5 millon fines</a> for
air pollution violations?</li>
  <li>Do all “green projects” actively <a href="https://www.greenbiz.com/article/europes-wood-pellet-market-worsening-environmental-racism-american-south">worsen environmental racism</a>?</li>
  <li>The biomass industry admits it will <a href="https://forestdefenders.eu/we-cant-wait-100-years-for-trees-to-grow-back-we-need-to-reduce-emissions-now/">take 100 years for carbon neutrality</a>.
Why are Drax lying about this?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pellet-production">Pellet production</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Wood pellet production has been described as so polluting that it “leaves people prisoners in their own homes”. Why don’t we use real renewable energy?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="beccs">BECCS</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Why is Drax not going ahead with your BECCS partnership with C-Capture? Was the partnership unsuccessful?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.desmog.co.uk/2019/07/17/comment-policymakers-shouldn-t-trust-drax-s-bizarre-tree-burning-climate-solution">More info about C-Capture</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>If the carbon capture technology is added to the biomass units, what is the energy penalty and how much additional biomass will need to be burned for the same electricity output that Drax Power Station currently generates?</strong></li>
  <li><strong>If the amount of wood burned at Drax doesn’t increase, how much less electricity will be generated? And what trials specific to the technology chosen are Drax’s BECCS assumptions based on?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>If BECCS technology were ever made to work in the future, it would mean an increased demand for wood to supply enough energy to capture and store the CO2. This would lead to more forest destruction and the conversion of huge areas of land to monoculture tree plantations in order to supply wood to burn in power stations <a href="https://www.scotsman.com/news/opinion/burning-trees-will-not-save-us-climate-crisis-richard-dixon-3112293">1</a></li>
      <li>For more information, <a href="https://www.foei.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Friends-of-the-Earth-International_BECCS_English.pdf">please see page 2 of this report from Friends of the Earth International</a>: “ Providing enough biomass for BECCS, at the scale needed, would only be possible through deforestation, land-grabbing, and by converting large amounts of arable land into monoculture plantations. This means that BECCS will create competition for land among food producers, as more and more cropland will be dedicated to growing crops for fuel. In fact, it is estimated that rolling out BECCS at scale will require up to 3000 million hectares – around twice the amount of land that is currently already cultivated, globally.”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>How much CO2 has Drax captured and stored so far in each of your two pilot projects and over what time period?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Drax plans to capture 1 tonne of CO2 per day but as yet, has released all of it back into the atmosphere. For more information, <a href="https://www.biofuelwatch.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/drax-briefing-update-2020_compressed.pdf">please see page 6 of this Drax briefing</a>.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>Drax brazenly claims that it has “<a href="https://www.drax.com/sustainability/environment/">a significant role to play in the transition to a low-carbon future</a>” – without alluding to the fact that closing down its power plant would cut the UK’s carbon dioxide emissions by over 17 million tonnes a year. Last year, Drax announced that it wanted to go further and turn its plant into the “<a href="https://www.drax.com/press_release/europes-first-bioenergy-carbon-capture-storage-pilot-now-underway/">first carbon negative power station</a>”.</p>

  <p>It entered into a partnership with startup company, <a href="https://www.c-capture.co.uk/">C-Capture</a>, to try and capture one tonne of carbon dioxide daily. This carbon dioxide was to be sold to pubs to “<a href="https://www.drax.com/press_release/drax-help-keep-fizz-drinks-sector/">help keep the fizz</a>” in beer.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.power-technology.com/features/draxs-carbon-capture/">As of May</a>, the process was not working reliably, and no carbon dioxide was stored or sold. <a href="https://www.biofuelwatch.org.uk/2019/beccs-pilot-farce/">This is not surprising</a>: C-Capture, though founded in 2009, had participated in no previous projects, obtained no patents and published no scientific studies. Instead of using a tried-and-tested solvent for capturing carbon, it chose to make its own, without disclosing any details. […]</p>

  <p><strong>The inclusion of BECCS into climate policies is dangerous: because BECCS is unlikely to work and, if it did, likely to result in extra carbon dioxide emissions from increased logging and land conversion.</strong></p>

<h4 id="burning-trees-will-not-save-us-from-the-climate-crisis---richard-dixon-26121"><a href="https://www.scotsman.com/news/opinion/burning-trees-will-not-save-us-climate-crisis-richard-dixon-3112293">Burning trees will not save us from the climate crisis - Richard Dixon (26/1/21)</a></h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>The new report shows how <strong>BECCS is being used as a get out of jail card by governments and companies to do little about climate change but tell us all it’s going to be alright</strong>. BECCS is popular because countries around the world looked at their expected emissions, saw the widening gap between the trajectory they are on and the targets they are supposed to meet, and simply plugged in the magic unicorn of BECCS to fill the gap.</p>

  <p><strong>[…] There is no fully-functioning BECCS scheme operating anywhere in the world.</strong></p>

  <p>Of course, planting trees can be a great thing to do but <strong>to make BECCS work at scale you need a huge amount of plant material or timber. This would only be possible by destroying natural forests and converting large areas of arable land into monoculture plantations, displacing people, trashing nature and competing with food production.</strong> One estimate is that we would need twice as much land as is currently cultivated on a global scale and, according to an assessment in 2019, BECCS at massive scale would threaten an additional 150 million people with hunger.</p>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>In recent years, however, there has been a misguided move to cut down whole trees or to divert large portions of stem wood for bioenergy, releasing carbon that would otherwise stay locked up in forests.</p>

  <p>The result of this additional wood harvest is a large initial increase in carbon emissions, creating a “carbon debt,” which increases over time as more trees are harvested for continuing bioenergy use. <strong>Regrowing trees and displacement of fossil fuels may eventually pay off this carbon debt, but regrowth takes time the world does not have to solve climate change.</strong></p>

  <p><strong>As numerous studies have shown, this burning of wood will increase warming for decades to centuries. That is true even when the wood replaces coal, oil or natural gas. […]</strong></p>

  <p><strong>To avoid these harms, governments must end subsidies and other incentives that today exist for the burning of wood whether from their forests or others. The European Union needs to stop treating the burning of biomass as carbon neutral in its renewable energy standards and in its emissions trading system.</strong></p>

<h4 id="global-markets-for-biomass-energy-are-devastating-us-forests-2019">“Global Markets for Biomass Energy are Devastating US Forests” (2019)</h4>

<p><a href="https://www.dogwoodalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Biomass-Investigation-Booklet-2019.pdf">Investigation booklet into the sourcing of wood biomass from Southern US forests</a> by the world’s largest wood pellet producer, Enviva. This wood is being transported from the Southern US to burn in UK &amp; European power stations, including Drax</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Despite the claims of the industry, the independent reporting shows a disturbing pattern: wood pellets burned by Drax and others come from wood that is harvested from native hardwood forests in an area designated as a global biodiversity hotspot.</strong> They also spotlight the vast quantities of whole trees and other large-diameter wood— biomass feedstocks known to be high-carbon—that are entering Enviva’s supply chain.</p>

  <p>**Not only is this devastating for these irreplaceable forests, but it’s worsening our Earth’s climate crisis. Multiple independent, peer-reviewed studies have determined that burning biomass from forests for electricity creates more carbon dioxide emissions than burning coal, and that increased carbon dioxide concentrations persist in the atmosphere for decades or more””</p>

  <p>In March 2019, investigators in North Carolina again tracked logging trucks from a mature hardwood forest to Enviva’s Northampton wood pellet mill. In January 2018, reporters from the UK Channel 4 News program Dispatches traveled to North Carolina to examine what is happening on the ground in the forests that have become ground zero for feeding Drax Power Station’s voracious demand for wood. <strong>The images from the Dispatches investigation tell a story of ecological devastation in the name of clean energy: a once majestic wetland forest clearcut to supply wood to Enviva, and ultimately to Drax.</strong></p>

Pinnacle “Renewable Energy”. This company log some of the last remaining old
forests in British Columbia, to be burned at Drax Power Station in
North Yorkshire.</p>

<p>They will be voting on this a the end of March, and remote votes must be in by
29th March. This is a surprise as Drax plan to have their Annual General
meeting on 21st April.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://www.stand.earth/latest/forest-conservation/forests-and-wood-pellets/drax-dont-burn-canada%E2%80%99s-old-growth-forests">this summary article</a> by Canadian organisation Stand.Earth. Stand.Earth
have also launched a full investigation into British Columbia’s which can be read
in <a href="https://www.stand.earth/sites/stand/files/report-canada-wood-pellet-industry.pdf">this document</a>.</p>

<p>In a quote taken from the above article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>UK residents may be shocked to learn that their power is being generated
  by burning some of the last stands of old and natural forests in British
  Columbia, home to endangered wildlife like caribou and among the most
  carbon-rich in the world—right up until they are clearcut to make wood
  pellets.</p>

  <p>In no world is this acceptable, and to be growing this sector during a
  global climate crisis is horrifying. Old growth forests in BC are nearly
  gone, and the provincial government campaigned on a commitment to protect
  old forests while pursuing a paradigm shift for forestry. We were promised
  a new future for forests, but allowing them instead to be clearcut and
  shipped overseas to be burned in coal converted plants is medieval.
  People living in the UK and Canada must come together to oppose this
  industry and support real, clean renewable energy that protects forests
  and our climate.</p>

<p>This <strong>cannot go unanswered in the UK</strong>, and we must take the short time
we have to do everything we can to stop Drax committing this climate
crime. We must remember that the <a href="https://www.biofuelwatch.org.uk/axedrax-campaign/"><strong>the UK Government fund Drax</strong></a> and that
any crime Drax commit the Government are complicit in.</p>

<p>We must come together and take action. Watch this space for suggestions.</p>

  the North. Actions will range from banner drops to family-friendly
  puppet shows and tree planting. Campaigners will also call on MPs
  to transfer around £1 billion in UK renewable subsidies from biomass
  burning power stations like Drax to genuine renewables.
</p>
<p>
  The Axe Drax protestors have three demands:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Stop Subsidising Ecocide: the government must remove the
      <a href="https://www.biofuelwatch.org.uk/axedrax-campaign/#C3">
        £789.5 million in subsidies
      </a>
      for Drax Power Station and transfer
      them to genuine renewables.
    </li>
    <li>
      Leave it in the Ground: stop Drax building Europe’s biggest ever
      fossil gas power station.
    </li>
    <li>
      Stop the Lies: end what is possibly the most comprehensive and
      dangerous greenwashing campaign the UK has seen.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

    Twelve times a day the Drax trains cross the viaduct in the centre of our
    little West Yorkshire town of Todmorden. They're really long, usually 25
    wagons,  and they really do draw your eye. The slogans on all the wagons
    look really progressive 'Biofuels-powering the future’ and 'Pioneering the
    northern powerhouse'. It’s only because I campaigned in the past over Drax's
    coal burning emissions that I decided to investigate their claims for myself.
    I found out they were greenwashing these claims and were not only causing
    massive environmental damage but huge social harm too.

  Drax Power Station, located in Yorkshire, <a href="https://www.biofuelwatch.org.uk/axedrax-campaign/#easy-footnote-1-9267">
    burns 12 million tonnes of trees
    every year
  </a>. Despite being legally classified as ‘renewable’
  by the UK government, it remains the largest carbon emitter in the
  UK. This takes advantage of a carbon accounting loophole,
  meaning that they are able to exclude the carbon cost of clear
  felling forests in the US when they are burned in the UK. In 2019
  Drax emitted almost 13 million tonnes of CO₂ from burning wood, and
  received £2.36 million in daily subsidy with £2.16 million counted
  as renewable subsidies. This is a grave misuse of public money,
  and Axe Drax are calling for an end to all subsidies for Drax and for
  them to be transferred towards funding genuine renewable energy projects.
</p>
<p>
  We are taking action, not only because of the environmental damage
  caused but the immediate and destructive impact Drax has upon human
  lives. Supposed bioenergy solutions often have the same fatal flaws
  associated with fossil fuels, they hurt low income BIPOC communities the
  most and serve to perpetuate environmental racism.
</p>
<p>
  In the Southern US, communities living in close proximity to the
  wood pellet mills used to supply Drax suffer from
  <a href="https://www.dogwoodalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Community-Voices-Fact-Sheet.pdf">
  air, water and noise pollution
  </a> as well as
  <a href="https://www.dogwoodalliance.org/2020/06/the-injustice-of-bioenergy-production/">
  poverty and injustice
  </a>. The
  destruction of forests caused by Drax also destroys
  biodiverse forests which local communities depend on for
  clean air and water. These forests have historically
  served to protect communities from extreme weather and flooding:
  only set to increase in the near future due to climate breakdown.

<p>
  Harm brought upon communities by Drax occurs closer to home too,
  following the train line of destruction through the North.
  The extreme amount of wood pellets imported through Liverpool
  Peel Ports by Drax has forced the port to expand. This has created
  large amounts of noise pollution and disruption upon local communities -
  all so that Drax can continue slashing down ancient woodlands and pumping
  pollution into our air. Noise pollution follows the train line, harming
  communities in Calderdale all the way along to Selby which suffers from
  the constant pumping of pollution into the air.
</p>
<p>
  Despite their constant greenwashing Drax continues to demonstrate a
  complete disregard for people's health, let alone the planet.
  In Selby, local air pollution levels are not measured - making it
  impossible for us to know exactly how much Drax is harming the health
  of local communities - despite the fact that York and the surrounding
  area have robust measuring systems in place. We know that
  <a href="https://www.pfpi.net/air-pollution-2">burning wood
  pellets emits a large amount of air pollution</a>, yet Drax fails to take
  responsibility for this.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    The practice of chopping down healthy trees to make pellets
    in the USA and importing these to the UK to be burned is just
    about as unsustainable as it gets.  Sadly, the Port of Liverpool
    is facilitating this.  With no hint of irony its owners, Peel
    Ports, bemoan the absence of East-West rail links for the
    movement of freight, but are more than happy to occupy a
    vital East-West link specifically for Drax, which could
    and should be being used to move containers.  Instead,
    Peel Ports are sitting back and waiting for the
    Government to build them a road for their HGVs, through a
    vital country park, destroying more trees in the process.
    This is what we're fighting and it's one of the reasons the
    Save Rimrose Valley campaign supports the calls Axe Drax.
    Big business literally bulldoze their way through our green
    spaces, harming the environment and impacting people's lives.

  <p>
    <strong>It has to stop.</strong>

<p>
  The push for biofuels as a renewable solution is only increasing as we
  hurt towards climate and ecological collapse. AxeDrax has come together
  to demand that we listen to the science which demonstrates biofuels are
  not a viable solution. We demand that our government invests money in
  genuine renewables, that prioritise the well-being of communities and our
  planet over profit.

<h3>Coronavirus</h3>

<p>
  Though we must take action, we must do so safely. Each of those taking
  action in person will be maintaining social distancing as far as
  possible, and will be wearing PPE with hand sanitizer available.
  We have provided safety guidelines to each group taking part in this
  action about following public health advice - as with climate change
  we aim to listen to the experts.
</p>
<p>
  We feel a duty to to balance the needs of people’s safety with the
  necessity of holding Drax accountable due to their greenwashing and
  ecologically destructive behaviour that destroys forests and livelihoods
  here in the North and in America. We are constantly making these decisions,
  and all are able to be changed if the situation regarding COVID-19 changes.
