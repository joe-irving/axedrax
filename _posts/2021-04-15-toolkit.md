  - "@SecVilsack, you sold off American forests as wood pellet fuel to the EU during the Obama administration. Burning forest wood is a false solution that undermines @POTUS climate goals. #FollowTheScience #NoFalseSolutions http://tiny.cc/notcarbonneutral"
  - "The #biomass industry excels at confusing people about carbon accounting, and their reward is billions in subsidies. It’s simple: burning trees adds carbon to the atmosphere. @SecGranholm: #NoFalseSolutions for #ClimateChange http://tiny.cc/notcarbonneutral"
  - "Will the Biden administration #FollowTheScience and protect our #forests and climate, or continue to throw money and resources at the #biomass industry that logs and burns forests for dirty energy? http://tiny.cc/notcarbonneutral"
  - "#Biomass energy is like a bad penny- always turning up in “clean energy” policies. @EPAMichaelRegan, @Gina_McCarthy, eat your Wheaties and stand up for science. #NoFalseSolutions http://tiny.cc/notcarbonneutral"
  - "The Biden team must vault over past mistakes and avoid the disastrous #biomass policies of the EU, where logging forests for fuel is rewarded with billions in renewable energy subsidies. #NoFalseSolutions http://tiny.cc/notcarbonneutral"
  - "#Biomass “carbon accounting” boils down to a very simple concept: burning wood moves forest carbon into the atmosphere. The industry wants to play a shell game with carbon, but the atmosphere sees all. #NoFalseSolutions http://tiny.cc/notcarbonneutral"
  - "The wood pellet industry is gutting US forests because the EU pretends burning trees is good for the climate. The #biomass folks would looooove to burn American trees in American coal plants. @SecGranholm, @EPAMichaelRegan, @Gina_McCarthy, don’t let that happen. http://tiny.cc/notcarbonneutra"
