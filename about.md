# Decentralised

Anyone can take action against Drax. We have no leaders. You don't need
to ask permission.

That being said, if you want help with an action or other plan then send
an email to [axedrax@pm.me](mailto:axedrax@pm.me) and someone will try
and link you up to other people.

# Action Focused

We plan and do actions. We protest. We make noise. We get embarrassed.
And when we must, we disrupt.

You don't have to physically take part in any action, and you definitely
don't have to do anything illegal unless you want to. There are always
thing to do, plan, organise that will need people. We are going up
against the a climate wrecking billion dollar company that deploys every
'lobbying technique' in the book. It is going to take work.

# Demands

1. Tell the Truth: Biomass ≠ Green
1. Defund Biomass
1. Fund Real Solutions

## Tell the Truth: Biomass ≠ Green

Governments and corporations be honest: biomass causes irreparable damage to the health of people and our life support systems. Classifying burning trees as renewable is a scam and the government is making us pay for it.

## Defund Biomass

Remove the ££ billions in subsidies given to Drax and other biomass power stations in the UK. This money funds death and destruction around the world, harming POC and poorer communities the most whilst corporations profit. If we stop the money, we stop the destruction.

## Fund Real Solutions

The £ billions given to biomass should be used to fund a just transition: furlough; retrain and transfer workers in the biomass industry; invest in education, affordable housing and health; fund genuine renewable energy. We must develop a plan of moving away from profit motives, which are fuelling the climate crisis, towards community based solutions.
