# Decentralised

Anyone can take action against Drax. We have no leaders. You don't need
to ask permission.

That being said, if you want help with an action or other plan then send
an email to [axedrax@pm.me](mailto:axedrax@pm.me) and someone will try
and link you up to other people.

# Action Focused

We plan and do actions. We protest. We make noise. We get embarrassed.
And when we must, we disrupt.

You don't have to physically take part in any action, and you definitely
don't have to do anything illegal unless you want to. There are always
thing to do, plan, organise that will need people. We are going up
against the a climate wrecking billion dollar company that deploys every
'lobbying technique' in the book. It is going to take work.

# Demands

1. Tell the truth
1. Defund Biomass
1. Fund Community Solutions

## Tell the truth

Biomass is not a renewable form of fuel. Destroying old growth forests for fuel is not sustainable. In the last year alone Drax received £832 million in subsidies from the UK government meant for renewables. This money, taken from the public, has been used to fund the destruction of forests and health world-wide. By classifying biomass as renewable this allows them to take billions from the public whilst destroying the planet. The government must be honest about the harm caused by biofuels, to the planet and people around the world.

It is time for governments and corporations to tell the truth about biomass.

## Defund Biomass

Remove the £billions in subsidies given Drax and other biomass power stations around the UK. This money is used to fund death and destruction around the world, harming people of colour and poorer communities the most whilst corporations profit. If we stop the money we stop the train of destruction.

## Fund Community Solutions

The £billions given to biomass should be used to fund a just transition: furlough; retrain and transfer workers in the biomass industry; invest in education, affordable housing and health; fund genuine renewable energy; develop a plan of de-growth moving away from profit motives fuelling the climate crisis towards community based solutions.

## More established groups

There is an amazing campaign running at the moment about biomass and the
UK Gov's genocidal climate policy called [Cut Carbon Not
Forests](https://www.cutcarbonnotforests.org) that is doing great work.
[Biofuelwatch](https://biofuelwatch.org.uk) have been campaigning around
this for years, and should be referred to if there are ever in need of
information about biomass and bioenergy.
