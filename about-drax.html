  <h1>Carbon belching</h1>
  <p>
    Drax makes claims about bold aims of becoming the first carbon negative
    power station by... <em>burning forests</em>. Since 2015, Drax has been
    burning more wood than the UK produces each year, making it the UK's
    single largest carbon emitter.
  </p>
  <p>
    The (failed) logic behind this is that there is no difference between
    trees dying and rotting than entire forests being clear-cut by huge
    machines, compressed and dried in huge factories, shipped across
    the Atlantic ocean, delivered to Drax and be incinerated at a rate of
    ~ 400kg <strong>per second</strong>. We'll let you make up your own
    mind on that one!
  </p>
  <p>
    In fact, on
    <a href="https://www.drax.com/sustainability/carbon-emissions/#carbon-emissions-2">
      their own website
    </a>,
    Drax quotes their carbon emissions as
    <q cite="https://www.drax.com/sustainability/carbon-emissions/#carbon-emissions-2">12,795&thinsp;ktCO<sub>2</sub>e</q>
    then follows that up by simply stating <q>CO2 emissions resulting from
    generation are counted as zero</q>. Despite the fact that the
    EU regulations that permit this practice were protested in
    <a href="http://www.pfpi.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/UPDATE-800-signatures_Scientist-Letter-on-EU-Forest-Biomass.pdf">
    this letter signed by over 800 scientists</a>.

  <h1>Money draining</h1>
  <p>
    In 2019, Drax was awarded <strong>£789.5 million</strong> in renewable
    energy subsidies that come straight from our energy bills. This is more
    than Drax made in profits. In other words <em>Drax rely on Government
    funding to survive</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since Drax has been scaling up it's forest burning, subsidies for genuine
    renewable energy - like solar energy - has decreased.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since the Government are funding Drax, they could stop the entire climate
    wrecking project quickly. In fact, a parliamentary vote is not required;
    the decision rests on Alok Sharma's Department for Business, Energy and
    Industrial Strategy. This seems unlikely when <strong><a href="https://www.theccc.org.uk/about/#sscouk_rut-19990">
    Drax have employees on the independent advisory board for climate change
    policy</a></strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 2018, the government effectively ruled out future subsidies
    for large-scale biomass by changing the criteria for efficiency
    and greenhouse gas emissions for new biomass power stations. If
    even the government admits that power stations like Drax are not
    a solution, why does Drax still get to boast green credentials?

  <h1>Health harming</h1>
  <p>
    In Feb 2021, one of Drax's pellet suppliers were
    <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/environment/2021/02/19/mississippi-wood-pellet-plant-supplies-uk-electricity-grid-fined/">
    fined $2.5 million for air pollution violations</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Less easily quantifiable than carbon emission or # million trees burned is
    the effect that Drax and it wood pellet suppliers have on the communities
    they reside within.
  </p>
  <h2 id="pellet-factories">Pellet factories</h2>
  <p>
    In the Southern US, communities living in close proximity to the
    wood pellet mills used to supply Drax suffer from
    <a href="https://www.dogwoodalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Community-Voices-Fact-Sheet.pdf">
    air, water and noise pollution
    </a> as well as
    <a href="https://www.dogwoodalliance.org/2020/06/the-injustice-of-bioenergy-production/">
    poverty and injustice
    </a>. The
    destruction of forests caused by Drax also destroys
    biodiverse forests which local communities depend on for
    clean air and water. These forests have historically
    served to protect communities from extreme weather and flooding:
    only set to increase in the near future due to climate breakdown.

      Enviva has made people prisoners in their own homes.
      People are profitting and we’re suffering

  <h2 id="ports">Ports</h2>
  <p>
    Harm brought upon communities by Drax occurs closer to home too,
    following the train line of destruction through the North.
    The extreme amount of wood imported through Liverpool
    Peel Ports by Drax has forced the port to expand. This has created
    large amounts of noise pollution and disruption upon local communities -
    all so that Drax can continue slashing down ancient woodlands and pumping
    pollution into our air. Noise pollution follows the train line, harming
    communities in Calderdale all the way along to Selby which suffers from
    the constant pumping of pollution into the air.
  </p>
  <p>
    Despite their constant greenwashing Drax continues to demonstrate a
    complete disregard for people's health, let alone the planet.
    In Selby, local air pollution levels are not measured - making it
    impossible for us to know exactly how much Drax is harming the health
    of local communities - despite the fact that York and the surrounding
    area have robust measuring systems in place. We know that
    <a href="https://www.pfpi.net/air-pollution-2">burning wood
    pellets emits a large amount of air pollution</a>, yet Drax fails to take
    responsibility for this.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      The practice of chopping down healthy trees to make pellets
      in the USA and importing these to the UK to be burned is just
      about as unsustainable as it gets.  Sadly, the Port of Liverpool
      is facilitating this.  With no hint of irony its owners, Peel
      Ports, bemoan the absence of East-West rail links for the
      movement of freight, but are more than happy to occupy a
      vital East-West link specifically for Drax, which could
      and should be being used to move containers.  Instead,
      Peel Ports are sitting back and waiting for the
      Government to build them a road for their HGVs, through a
      vital country park, destroying more trees in the process.
      This is what we're fighting and it's one of the reasons the
      Save Rimrose Valley campaign supports the calls Axe Drax.
      Big business literally bulldoze their way through our green
      spaces, harming the environment and impacting people's lives.

  <h1>Greenwashing</h1>
  <p>
    Drax makes bold claims about being the first carbon negative
    power station through its pilot project to capture carbon emissions
    from its tree burning. Yet,
    <a href="https://www.desmog.co.uk/2019/07/17/comment-policymakers-shouldn-t-trust-drax-s-bizarre-tree-burning-climate-solution">
    this bioenergy with carbon capture and storage technology is unproven</a>
    and even if it did work, it would lead to more forest destruction
    and increased carbon emissions.
