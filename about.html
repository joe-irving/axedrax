  <h1>Decentralised</h1>
  <p>
    Anyone can take action against Drax.
    We have no leaders. You don't need to ask permission.
  </p>
  <p>
    That being said, if you want help with an action or other plan
    then send an email to <a href="mailto:axedrax@pm.me">axedrax@pm.me</a>
    and someone will try and link you up to other people.

  <h1>Action Focused</h1>
  <p>
    We plan and do actions. We protest. We make noise. We get embarrassed.
    And when we must, we disrupt.
  </p>
  <p>
    You don't have to physically take part in any action, and you definitely
    don't have to do anything illegal unless you want to. There are always thing
    to do, plan, organise that will need people. We are going up against the
    climate policy of a company that literally has staff on the "independent"
    Committee on Climate Change. It is going to take work.

  <h1>Power to the people</h1>
  <p>
    It is important we appreciated Drax as part of a larger, failing, system.
    The fact that Drax can get away with unmeasured pollution and dangerous
    "green energy" is testament to the failure of the current political
    system. We must move to a world where people are in control, not
    big businesses like Drax.
  </p>
  <p>
    If an informed, legally binding, citizen's assembly were to decide where
    government money goes we would not be in this mess. We must fight for it.
  </p>
  <p>
    The future of this country is community based, moving away from a
    privatised and centralised energy system to one that works for everyone.
    Thinking globally, and acting locally.

  <h3>More established groups</h3>
  <p>
    There is an amazing campaign running at the moment about biomass
    and the UK Gov's genocidal climate policy called
    <a href="https://www.cutcarbonnotforests.org">Cut Carbon Not Forests</a>
    that is doing great work.
    <a href="https://biofuelwatch.org.uk">Biofuelwatch</a> have been
    campaigning around this for years, and should be referred to if there
    are ever in need of information about biomass and bioenergy.
