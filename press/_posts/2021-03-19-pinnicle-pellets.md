Drax Plc plan to buy further into the wood burning industry, by purchasing
Pinnacle "Renewable Energy". This company log some of the last remaining old
forests in British Columbia, to be burned at Drax Power Station in
North Yorkshire.

They will be voting on this a the end of March, and remote votes must be in by
29th March. This is a surprise as Drax plan to have their Annual General
meeting on 21st April.

See [this summary article][1] by Canadian organisation Stand.Earth. Stand.Earth
have also launched a full investigation into British Columbia's which can be read
in [this document][2].

In a quote taken from the above article:

> UK residents may be shocked to learn that their power is being generated
  by burning some of the last stands of old and natural forests in British
  Columbia, home to endangered wildlife like caribou and among the most
  carbon-rich in the world—right up until they are clearcut to make wood
  pellets.
>
>In no world is this acceptable, and to be growing this sector during a
  global climate crisis is horrifying. Old growth forests in BC are nearly
  gone, and the provincial government campaigned on a commitment to protect
  old forests while pursuing a paradigm shift for forestry. We were promised
  a new future for forests, but allowing them instead to be clearcut and
  shipped overseas to be burned in coal converted plants is medieval.
  People living in the UK and Canada must come together to oppose this
  industry and support real, clean renewable energy that protects forests
  and our climate.
>- Tegan Hansen, Forest Campaigner, Stand.earth

This **cannot go unanswered in the UK**, and we must take the short time
we have to do everything we can to stop Drax committing this climate
crime. We must remember that the [**the UK Government fund Drax**][3] and that
any crime Drax commit the Government are complicit in.

We must come together and take action. Watch this space for suggestions.

Areas we need help in:
* Managing our social media
* Writing press releases
* Affinity groups prepared to take action independently
* People who can make info-graphics

Contact us on [axedrax [at] pm.me](mailto:axedrax@pm.me) if you would like to
get involved in organising against Drax. Any amount of help is appreciated. You
