# Be kind

People taking part in remote actions are asked to treat the people on the phone or over email and social media with respect. Please do not harass or threaten anyone over the phone during this action, as this is not necessary and can put you at risk of charge. Our job is to educate people on the harm of large scale biomass projects. Making calls to be annoying is not helpful for the following numbers, as you will most likely just be talking to a secretary or possibly a call centre worker.

If however, you manage to in contact with anyone who actually has power be as
annoying as you like!

# Briefing

1. For each contact, there is a main script, a nuance document and a left message.
      * **Main Script**: skeleton guidance for your call. From ‚Äúhello‚Äù through to ending the conversation.
      * **Nuance document**: Link to key information about the campaign and Drax facts. Divided thematically.
      * **Left message**: Suggested voicemail message to leave contacts who don‚Äôt answer your call.
1. Follow up with an email.
  * Make sure to BCC [axedrax@pm.me](mailto;axedrax@pm.me), so in theory we
  can predict responses in future - or center actions around them.


## Tips. DO...

1. **DO know the script**: familiarise yourself with the content and flow. Read it out to yourself. You can even try as a role play with someone you trust (this could be a friend or a member of your local XR group/organisation). This is a way to build confidence before the action :)
1. **DO strive for connection**: Try to imagine they‚Äôre sitting across from you. Ask questions and try to create a natural ‚Äúback and forth‚Äù. The better you know the script, the easier this will be.  
1. **DO refer to #AxeDrax and affiliated groups in the third person**: People are more likely to be persuaded by the aims and purpose of the action/campaign, rather than by a stranger telling them how to feel.

## Tips. DON‚ÄôT ‚Ä¶

1. **DON‚ÄôT worry if you go off script**: in fact we encourage riffing on it. However, there are a few pitfalls to avoid such as‚Ä¶
1. **DON‚ÄôT make assumptions** about their age, race, gender, or their attitudes about Drax.
1. **DON‚ÄôT debate or argue**: our task is to educate and not to annoy or anger anybody. If someone is genuinely asking questions, do your best to answer them. However, if someone is clearly disagreeing with you and trying to argue or debate, don‚Äôt engage. It‚Äôs always OK to say, ‚ÄúI have a lot of calls left to make today so I do have to go. Thanks for your time‚Äù.

## üßê For your local MP and Ed Milliband

[Find their details here](https://members.parliament.uk/member/)

### Left message

Good morning/afternoon. This is \_\_\_\_\_ and I am a constituent of \_\_\_\_\_. I‚Äôm reaching out to you to discuss the harmful effect Drax Power Station‚Äôs tree burning is having on communities in the UK, in the hopes that you can help to reduce biomass subsidies by writing to Alok Sharma and Kwasi Karteng. If you‚Äôd like to hear about this please return my call on [Number] before 5pm today. Thank you.

### Main script

1. Good morning/Good afternoon, is **[YOUR MP]** available?
2. Hello \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ . This is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ calling on behalf of the #AxeDrax campaign. I am a constituent of **[YOUR CONSTITUENCY]**. I'm phoning because I am very concerned about the climate crisis and I am particularly worried about Drax Power Station's fossil fuel and tree burning. Are you aware that Drax Power Station is the greatest emitter of CO<sub>2</sub> in the UK?
    1. **(IF NO)** OK. Although Drax is phasing out coal, their power stations are being converted into biomass plants, with the false claims that this is renewable energy, when in truth burning trees for energy contributes more CO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere than coal per unit of electricity produced. _Continue to 3_
    2. **(IF YES)** That‚Äôs good to know that you are aware that the biomass industry isn‚Äôt as clean as Drax claims. _Continue to 3_
3. Would you be willing to hear more about how Drax is harming communities in the UK?
    3. **(IF NO)** No problem. I think it's really important that we remove Drax‚Äôs biofuel subsidies, and redirect those towards truly renewable sources of energy, such as solar and wind, instead of using them to transport wood pellets across the planet. It would be great if you could write to the BEIS ministers Alok Sharma and Kwasi Karteng, ask Parliamentary Questions about biofuel subsidies, and perhaps request a parliamentary debate around the issue.
    4. **(IF YES)** Great. You might already know that the beginning of Drax‚Äôs biomass production is in the Southern USA, where large areas of forests are torn down and pelletised in factories. This process harms the communities because it takes away nature and increases pollution, ultimately having a negative effect on health. In the UK, these wood pellets come into a number of ports, one of the biggest being Liverpool‚Äôs Peel Ports. Communities in this area experience air pollution as a result of this, and Highways England are also planning to destroy the much loved Rimrose Valley to build a road that will increase transportation of wood pellets to Drax‚Äôs Power Station in Yorkshire, despite the claim that it will reduce traffic. This is one of several examples of communities that were never given a choice. Would you be willing to use your authority as an MP to change this?
        1. **(IF YES)** Please could you write to Alok Sharma and Kwasi Karteng and ask them to switch biomass subsidies to genuine renewables under the Levy Control Framework, ask Parliamentary Questions about biofuel subsidies, and perhaps request a parliamentary debate around the issue. We can send you [a briefing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DYlkCzT29UNlhdWeM9ceQBJPqPFXlN4Z/view?usp=sharing) on this issue, please could you forward any replies back to my email. Thanks again for listening, have a good day.
        2. **(IF NO).** That‚Äôs OK. Thank you for talking to me, have a good day.


## Alok Sharma

### Left message

Good morning/afternoon. This is _____. I‚Äôm reaching out to you to discuss the harmful effect Drax Power Station is having on communities in the UK, in the hopes that you can transfer biomass subsidies to genuine renewables. Please pass on the message to Alok Sharma. If you‚Äôd like to hear about this please return my call on [Number] before 5pm today. Thank you.

### Main script

1. Good morning/Good afternoon, is Alok Sharma available?
    1. _Unless you are very lucky, this will be a resounding no. But it's fun to ask nonetheless!_
2. Hello \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ . This is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ calling on behalf of the #AxeDrax campaign. I am calling to talk to you about Drax Power Station. Are you aware that Drax Power Station is the greatest emitter of CO<sub>2</sub> in the UK?
    2. **(IF YES)** - That‚Äôs good to know _(Skip to **3**) _
    3. **(IF NO)** - No problem (**Explain about Drax, use the FAQ document**)
3.  That‚Äôs good to know that you are aware that the biomass industry isn‚Äôt as clean as Drax claims. Would you be willing to hear more about how Drax is harming communities in the UK and USA?
    4. **(IF YES)** - Great! You might already know that the beginning of Drax‚Äôs biomass production is in the Southern USA, where large areas of forests are torn down and pelletised in factories. This process harms the communities because it takes away nature and increases pollution, ultimately having a negative effect on health. In the UK, these wood pellets come into a number of ports, one of the biggest being Liverpool‚Äôs Peel Ports. Communities in this area experience air pollution as a result of this, and Highways England are also planning to destroy the much loved Rimrose Valley to build a road that is likely to increase transportation of wood pellets to Drax‚Äôs Power Station in Yorkshire, despite the claim that it will reduce traffic. This is one of several examples of communities that were never given a choice. Could you take these issues to Alok Sharma and ask him to move subsidies for biomass to genuine renewables under the Levy Control Framework. _(ask for direct email to send details on)_
    5. **(IF NO)** - No problem. Thank you for your time and have a good day.


## Yeo Valley

[**01761 462 798**](tel:01761462798)

NB Yeo Valley already get power from Octopus Energy (generally good & not from Drax) as well as Haven Power

### Left message

Good morning/afternoon. My name is \_\_\_\_\_ and I am calling from the Axe Drax campaign.  Could you please get back to me on _[Number]_ about whether Yeo Valley would consider not sourcing its electricity through Haven Power, and fully switch to a provider that does not pollute communities?

### Main Script


1. Hello \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ . This is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ calling on behalf of the #AxeDrax campaign. It has come to our attention that Yeo Valley‚Äôs energy comes from Haven Power which is owned by Drax. Are you aware that Drax Power Station is the greatest emitter of CO<sub>2</sub> in the UK? \

2. **(IF NO).** OK. Although Drax is phasing out coal, their power stations are being converted into biomass plants, with the false claims that this is renewable energy, when in truth it contributes more CO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere than coal for the same amount of electricity. Would you be willing to hear more about how Drax is harming communities in the UK and the US?
    1. **(IF NO)** No problem. I think it is really important that companies like Yeo Valley stop supporting companies like Haven Power, Drax, and Enviva which take part in logging operations in the Southern USA that contribute to air, water and noise pollution in predominantly Black, indigenous and low-income communities - all hidden under lies about renewable energy. Would you be willing to write to me about whether Yeo Valley will continue to support the harmful, polluting biomass industry? _(give them your contact details if not hung up yet)_
    2. **(IF YES)** Great. You might already know that the beginning of Drax‚Äôs biomass production is mostly in the Southern USA, where large areas of forests are torn down and pelletised in factories. This process contributes to air, water and noise pollution that hurts predominantly poorer and non-white communities. In the UK, these wood pellets come into a number of ports, one of the biggest being Liverpool‚Äôs Peel Ports. People in the area experience harmful air pollution due to this, and Highways England are also planning to destroy the much loved Rimrose Valley to build a road that is likely to increase transportation of wood pellets to Drax‚Äôs Power Station in Yorkshire, despite the claim that it will reduce traffic. This is one of several examples of communities that were never given a choice. Can you see the harm that Drax‚Äôs wood burning electricity is causing? _(hypothetical, skip straight to 3.)_
3. **(IF YES)** As YeoValley is an ethical company that promotes the importance of biodiversity are you going to switch from Haven Power to a genuine renewable energy supplier?
    3. **(IF YES)** Could you put that in writing to me on [your email]? _(forward this to [axedrax@pm.me](mailto:axedrax@pm.me) if possible)_
    4. **(IF NO)** Drax Power Station fuels forest destruction that ultimately will make all of our lives worse. Please could you take my concern to your sustainability lead, and get back to me in writing about your decision?_ (make them take your contact details. Forward any correspondences to [axedrax@pm.me](mailto:axedrax@pm.me)) _

# Nuances

*   Burning wood is less efficient than burning coal
*   Drax imports more wood to burn than the UK produces each year
*   Drax releases more carbon each year than the UK needs to reduce its emissions by to meet its carbon targets
*   Drax were given ¬£789.5m in 2019 for its wood burning; this can be easily transferred to genuine renewables under the Levy Control Framework
*   Pellet production produces air, water and noise pollution.
*   Logging operations in the Southeastern USA make it less protected from inevitable extreme weather events like hurricanes and flooding
    *   North Carolina and Robeson County are key area, if you need a specific example
