"While many of us have been enjoying the respite of some clean air, those living near Drax Power Station in the UK and near its pellet supplies factories in the USA have not had the same break.

Drax continues to pollute communities and increase the chance of heart disease, respiratory illness and cancer. For the sake of people’s live, it is time to #AxeDrax and move the ridiculous £789.5 million of “renewable energy” subsidies which Drax received in 2019 to genuine renewables that don’t harm communities and provide secure green jobs.  #CutCarbonNotForests

"""When I heard about Enviva coming to Richmond County, it felt like my heart dropped in my stomach. Nobody educated our little town here - not on the Perdue Chicken Plant, on the CSX railway, or on the Enviva wood pellet plant.

""My hope for my community is that we all join together and fight together and win the biomass challenge. Winning would make me feel so good. It would allow me to be able to go to another community and help them. We won't stop when we win - we will keep going.""
